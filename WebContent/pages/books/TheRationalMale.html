<img scr="img/books/red1.jpeg">
<p>ONEitis is paralysis. You cease to mature, you cease to move, you cease to be you.</p>
<p>
  There is no ONE. This is the soulmate myth. There are some good Ones and some bad Ones, but <strong>there is no ONE</strong>. Anyone telling you anything else is selling you something. There are
  LOTS of &#8216;special someones&#8217; out there for you, just ask the divorced/widowed person who&#8217;s remarried after their &#8220;soulmate&#8221; has died or moved on.
</p>
<p>This is what trips people up about the soul-mate myth, it is this fantasy that we all at least in some way share an idealization of – that there is ONE perfect mate for each of us, and as soon
  as the planets align and fate takes it&#8217;s course we&#8217;ll know that we&#8217;re &#8216;intended&#8217; for each other. And while this may make for a gratifying romantic comedy plot,
  it&#8217;s hardly a realistic way to plan your life. In fact it&#8217;s usually paralyzing.</p>
<p>What I find even more fascinating is how common the idea is (mostly for guys) that a nuts &amp; bolts view of life should be trumped by this fantasy in the area of inter-sexual relationships.
  Guys who would otherwise recognize the value of understanding psychology, biology, sociology, evolution, business, engineering, etc. and the interplay we see these take place in our lives on a daily
  basis, are some of the first guys to become violently opposed to the idea that maybe there isn&#8217;t &#8216;someone for everyone&#8217; or that there are a lot more ONEs out there that could meet
  or exceed the criteria we subconsciously set for them to be the ONE. I think it comes off as nihilistic or this dread that maybe their ego investment in this belief is false- it&#8217;s like saying
  God is dead to the deeply religious. It&#8217;s just too terrible to contemplate that there maybe no ONE or there maybe several ONEs to spend their lives with. This western romanticized mythology is
  based on the premise that there is only ONE perfect mate for any single individual and as much as a lifetime can and should be spent in constant search of this &#8216;soulmate.&#8217; So strong and
  so pervasive is this myth in our collective society that it has become akin to a religious statement and in fact has been integrated into many religious doctrines as feminization of western culture
  has spread.</p>
<p>
  I think there&#8217;s been a mischaracterization of ONEitis. It&#8217;s necessary to differentiate between a healthy relationship based on mutual respect and a lopsided ONEitis based relationship.
  I&#8217;ve had more than a few guys seeking my advice, or challenging my take on ONEitis, essentially ask me for permission to accept ONEitis as legitimate monogamy. In my estimation <strong>ONEitis
    is an unhealthy psychological dependency that is the direct result of the continuous socialization of the soulmate myth in pop culture. </strong>What&#8217;s truly frightening is that ONEitis has become
  associated with being a healthy normative aspect of an LTR or marriage.
</p>
<p>I come to the conclusion that ONEitis is based in sociological roots, not only due to it being a statement of personal belief, but by the degree to which this ideology is disseminated and mass
  marketed in popular culture through media, music, literature, movies, etc. Dating services like eHarmony shamelessly marketeer and exploit exactly the insecurities that this dynamic engenders in
  people desperately searching for the ONE &#8220;they were intended for.&#8221; The idea that men possess a natural capacity for protection, provisioning and monogamy has merit from both a social and
  bio-psychological standpoint, but a ONEitis psychosis is not a byproduct of it. Rather, I would set it apart from this healthy protector/provider dynamic since ONEitis essentially sabotages what our
  natural propensities would otherwise filter.</p>
<p>ONEitis is insecurity run amok while a person is single, and potentially paralyzing when coupled with the object of that ONEitis in an LTR. The same neurotic desperation that drives a person to
  settle for their ONE whether healthy or unhealthy is the same insecurity that paralyzes them from abandoning a damaging relationship &#8211; This is their ONE and how could they ever live without
  them? Or, they&#8217;re my ONE, but all I need is to fix myself or fix them to have my idealized relationship. And this idealization of a relationship is at the root of ONEitis. With such a
  limiting, all-or-nothing binary approach to searching for ONE needle in the haystack, and investing emotional effort over the course of a lifetime, how do we mature into a healthy understanding of
  what that relationship should really entail? The very pollyanna, idealized relationship &#8211; the &#8220;happily ever after&#8221; &#8211; that belief in a ONE promotes as an ultimate end, is
  thwarted and contradicted by the costs of the constant pursuit of the ONE for which they&#8217;ll settle for. After the better part of a lifetime is invested in this ideology, how much more
  difficult will it be to come to the realization that the person they&#8217;re with isn&#8217;t their ONE? To what extents will a person go to in order to protect a lifetime of this ego investment?</p>
<p>At some point in a ONEitis relationship one participant will establish dominance based on the powerlessness that this ONEitis necessitates. There is no greater agency for a woman than to know
  beyond doubt that she is the only source of a man&#8217;s need for sex and intimacy. ONEitis only cements this into the understanding of both parties. For a man who believes that the emotionally and
  psychologically damaging relationship he has ego-invested himself is with the only person in his lifetime he&#8217;s ever going to be compatible with, there is nothing more paralyzing in his
  maturation. The same of course holds true for women, and this is why we shake our heads when the beautiful HB 9 goes chasing back to her abusive and indifferent Jerk boyfriend, because she believes
  he is her ONE and the only source of security available to her. Hypergamy may be her root imperative for sticking with him, but it&#8217;s the soul-mate myth, the fear of the &#8220;ONE that got
  away&#8221; that makes for the emotional investment.</p>
<p>The definition of Power is not financial success, status or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives. Subscribing to the soulmate mythology necessitates
  that we recognize powerlessness in this arena of our lives. Better I think it would be to foster a healthy understanding that there is no ONE. There are some good Ones and there are some bad Ones,
  but there is no ONE.</p>

  <h1 class="entry-title">The Cardinal Rule of&nbsp;Relationships</h1>
</header>
<!-- .entry-header -->

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>
    <em>In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a foundation of <em>any</em> relationship, not just intersexual ones, but family, business, etc. relationships as well. It is a dynamic that is always in effect. For my own well being and
    that of my family&#8217;s, I need my employer more than he needs me, ergo I get up for work in the morning and work for him. And while I am also a vital part for the uninterrupted continuance of
    his company and endeavours, he simply needs me less than I need him. Now I could win the lottery tomorrow or he may decide to cut my pay or limit my benefits, or I may complete my Masters Degree
    and decide that I can do better than to keep myself yoked to his cart indefinitely, thereby, through some condition either initiated by myself or not, I am put into a position of needing him less
    than he needs me. At this point he is forced into a position of deciding how much I am worth to his ambitions and either part ways with me or negotiate a furtherance of our relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same plays true for intersexual relationships. Whether you want to base your relationship on &#8216;power&#8217; or not isn&#8217;t the issue; it&#8217;s already in play from your first point
    of attraction. You are acceptable to her for meeting any number of criteria and she meets your own as well. If this weren&#8217;t the case you simply would not initiate a mutual relationship. This
    is the first comparisson we make with another individual &#8211; call it &#8216;sizing up&#8217; if you like &#8211; but we make innate (and often unconscious) comparisons about <em>everything</em>
    and in the case of initial attraction we decide if the the other person is acceptable for our own intimacy. From this point it becomes a cooperative negotiation.
  </p>
  <p>This principle isn&#8217;t so much about &#8216;power&#8217; as it is about control. This might sound like semantics, but it does make a difference. It&#8217;s very easy to slip into binary
    arguments and think that what I mean by the cardinal rule of relationships is that one participant must absolutely rule over the other &#8211; a domineering dominant personality to a doormat
    submissive personality. Control in a healthy relationship passes back and forth as desire and need dictate for each partner. In an unhealthy realationship you have an unbalanced manipulation of
    this control by a partner.</p>
  <p>Although control is never in complete balance, it becomes manipulation when one partner, in essence, blackmails the other with what would otherwise be a behavioral reinforcer for the
    manipulated partner under healthy circumstances. This happens for a variety of different reasons, but the condition comes about by two ways &#8211; the submissive participant becomes conditioned
    to allow the manipulation to occur and/or the dominant one initiates the manipulation. In either case the rule still holds true &#8211; the one who needs the other the least has the most control.
    Nowhere is this more evident than in interpersonal relationships.</p>
  <p>
    Too many people who I counsel and read my posts (here and elsewhere) assume that this Rule means that I&#8217;m advocating the maintaining a position of dominance at the expense of their partners;
    far from it. I do however advocate that people &#8211; young men in particular &#8211; develop a better sense of self-worth and a better understanding of their true efficacy in their relationships
    (assuming you decide to become involved in one). Don&#8217;t get me wrong, both sexes are guilty of manipulation; Battered women go back to their abusive boyfriends/husbands and pussy whipped men
    compromise themselves and their ambitions to better serve their girlfriend’s insecurities. My intent in promoting this Rule is to open the eyes of young men who are already predisposed to
    devaluing themselves and placing women as the goal of their lives rather than seeing themselves as the PRIZE to be sought after. Compromise is always going to be a part of any relationship, but
    what&#8217;s key is realizing when that compromise becomes the result of manipulation, what is in effect, <span>then </span>developing the confidence to be uncompromising in those situations. This
    is where a firm understanding of the cardinal rule of relationships becomes essential.
  </p>
  <p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with backing down from an argument you have with your girlfriend, but there is something wrong when you continually compromise yourself in order to &#8216;keep the
    peace&#8217; with the understanding that she&#8217;ll withhold intimacy as a result of you holding your ground. That is a power play, also known as a &#8216;shit test&#8217;. She initiates it thus
    becoming the controlling party.</p>
  <p>
    No woman&#8217;s intimacy (i.e. sex) is <em>ever</em> worth that compromise because in doing so you devalue your own worth to her. Once this precident is set, she will progressively have less
    respect for you &#8211; exactly opposite of the popular conception that she&#8217;ll appreciate your compromising for her and reward you for your “sensitivity”.
  </p>
  <p>And really, what are you compromising in order to achieve? Set in this condition, her intimacy. That isn&#8217;t genuine desire or real interest in you, it&#8217;s a subtle psychological test
    (that all too many men are unaware of) meant to determine who needs the other more. There is no more a superior confidence for a man than one with the self-understanding that he will not
    compromise himself for the recognized manipulations of a woman, and the fortitude to walk away knowing he can and will find a better prospect than her. This is the man who passes the shit test.
    It&#8217;s called &#8216;enlightened self-interest&#8217; -— I cannot help others until I can help myself — and a principle I wholely endorse.</p>

  <h1>THE DESIRE DYNAMIC</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>You cannot negotiate Desire.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This is a very simple principle that most Men and the vast majority of women are willfully ignorant of. One the most common personal problems I&#8217;ve been asked advice for in the past 10
    years is some variation of &#8220;how do I get her back?&#8221; Usually this breaks down into men seeking some methodology to return his relationship to an earlier state where a previously
    passionate woman couldn&#8217;t keep her hands off of him. Six months into a comfortable familiarity and the thrill is gone, but in truth it&#8217;s the genuine desire that is gone.</p>
  <p>It&#8217;s often at this stage that a man will resort to negotiation. Sometimes this can be as subtle as him progressively doing things for her in the hopes that she&#8217;ll reciprocate with
    the same sexual fervor they used to have. Other times a married couple may go to marriage counseling to &#8220;resolve their sex issues&#8221; and negotiate terms for her sexual compliance.
    He&#8217;ll promise to do the dishes and a load of laundry more often in exchange for her feigned sexual interest in him. Yet, no matter what terms are offered, no matter how great an external
    effort he makes so deserving of reward, the genuine desire is not there for her. In fact, she feels worse for not having the desire after such efforts were made for her compliance.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Negotiated desire only ever leads to obligated compliance.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This is why her post-negotiation sexual response is often so lackluster and the source of even further frustration on his part. She may be more sexually available to him, but the half-hearted
    experience is never the same as when they first met when there was no negotiation, just spontaneous desire for each other.</p>
  <p>From a male perspective, and particularly that of an uninitiated beta male, negotiation of desire seems a rational solution to the problem. Men tend to innately rely on deductive reasoning;
    otherwise known as an &#8220;if then&#8221; logic stream. The code is often something like this:</p>
  <p>I need sex + women have the sex I want + query women about their conditions for sex + meet prerequisites for sex = the sex I want.</p>
  <p>
    Makes sense right? It&#8217;s simple economics, but built on a foundation that relies on a woman&#8217;s accurate self-evaluations. The genuine desire they used to experience at the outset of
    their relationship was predicated upon a completely unknown set of variables. Overtly communicating a desire for reciprocal desire creates obligation, and sometimes even ultimatums. Genuine desire
    is something a person must come to &#8211; or be led to &#8211; on their own volition. You can force a woman by threat to comply with behaving in a desired manner, but you cannot make her <em>want</em>
    to behave that way. A prostitute will fuck you for an exchange, it doesn&#8217;t mean she wants to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether LTR or a one night stand (ONS) strive for genuine desire in your relationships. Half of the battle is knowing you want to be with a woman who <em>wants</em> to please you, not one who
    feels obligated to. You will never draw this genuine desire from her by overt means, but you can covertly lead her to this genuine desire. The trick in provoking real desire is in keeping her
    ignorant of your intent to provoke it. Real desire is created by her thinking it&#8217;s something she wants, not something she has to do.
  </p>
  <h1>SCHEDULES OF MATING</h1>
  <p>
    There are methods and social contrivances women have used for centuries to ensure that the best male&#8217;s genes are selected and secured with the best male provisioning she&#8217;s capable of
    attracting. Ideally the best Man should exemplify both, but <strong>rarely do the two exist in the same male</strong> (particularly these days) so in the interest of achieving her biological
    imperative, and prompted by an innate need for security, the feminine as a whole had to develop social conventions and methodologies (which change as her environment and personal conditions do) to
    effect this. Men are not only up against a female genetic imperative, but also centuries long feminine social conventions established and adapted from a time long before human beings could
    accurately determine genetic origins.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#8217;ve detailed in many prior threads that mate selection is a psycho-biological function that millennia of evolution has hardwired into both sexes. So internalized and socialized is this
    process into our collective psyches that we rarely recognize we&#8217;re subject to these motivators even when we continually repeat the same behaviors manifested by them (such as having the <em>second</em>
    kid with the Alpha Bad Boy). So saying that we&#8217;re not subject to conditions we&#8217;re or are only vaguely aware of is a bit naive.
  </p>
  <p>It&#8217;s simple deductive logic to follow that for a species to survive it must provide its offspring with the best possible conditions to ensure its survival &#8211; either that or to
    reproduce in such quantity that it ensures survival. The obvious application of this for women is sharing parental investment with the best possible mate her own genetics allow her to attract and
    who can provide long term security for her and any potential offspring. Thus women are biologically, psychologically and sociologically the filters of their own reproduction, where as men&#8217;s
    reproductive methodology is to scatter as much of his genetic material as humanly possible to the widest available quantity of sexually available females. He of course has his own criteria for
    mating selection and determining the best genetic pairing for his reproduction (i.e. she&#8217;s gotta be hot), but his criteria is certainly less discriminating than that for women (i.e. no
    one&#8217;s ugly after 2am). This is evidenced in our own hormonal biology; men possess between 12 and17 times the amount of testosterone (the primary hormone in sexual arousal) women do and women
    produce substantially more estrogen (instrumental in sexual caution) and oxytocin (fostering feelings of security and nurturing) than men.</p>
  <p>That stated, both of these methodologies conflict in practice. For a woman to best ensure the survival of her young, a man must necessarily abandon his method of reproduction in favor of her
    own. This then sets a contradictory imperative for him to pair with a woman who will satisfy his methodology. A male must sacrifice his reproductive schedule to satisfy that of the woman he pairs
    with. Thus, with so much genetic potential at stake on his part of the risk, he want&#8217;s not only to ensure that she is the best possible candidate for breeding (and future breeding), but also
    to know that his progeny will benefit from both parent&#8217;s investment.</p>
  <p>Side note: One interesting outcome of this psycho-biological dynamic is men&#8217;s ability to spot their own children in a crowd of other children more quickly and with greater acuity than
    even their mothers. Studies have shown that men have the ability to more quickly and accurately identify their own children in a room full of kids dressed in the same uniforms than the mothers of
    the child. Again, this stresses the subconscious importance of this genetic trade off.</p>
  <p>These are the rudiments of human sexual selection and reproduction. There are many other social, emotional, psychological intricacies that are associated with these fundamentals, but they are
    the underlying motivations and considerations that subconsciously influence sexual selection.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Social Convention</strong><br /> To counter this subconscious dynamic to their own genetic advantage women initiate social conventions and psychological schemas to better facilitate their
    own breeding methodologies. This is why women always have the &#8220;prerogative to change her mind&#8221; and the most fickle of behaviors become socially excusable, while men&#8217;s behavior is
    constrained to a higher standard of responsibility to &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; which is invariably to the advantage of a woman&#8217;s reproductive scheme . This is why guys who are
    &#8216;Players&#8217;, and fathers who abandon mothers to pursue their innate reproduction method are villains, and fathers who selflessly sacrifice themselves financially, emotionally and life
    decision-wise, often to the benefit of children they didn&#8217;t father, are considered social heroes for complying with women&#8217;s genetic imperatives.
  </p>
  <p>This is also the root motivation for female-specific social dynamics such as LJBF rejections, women&#8217;s propensity for victimhood (as they&#8217;ve learned that this engenders
    &#8216;savior&#8217; mental schemas for men&#8217;s breeding schedules &#8211; Cap&#8217;n Save a Ho) and even marriage itself.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Good Dads vs Good Genes</strong><br /> The two greatest difficulties for women to overcome in their own methodology is that they are only at a sexually viable peak for a short window of
    time (generally their 20s) and the fact that the qualities that make a good long term partner (the Good Dad) and the qualities that make for good breeding stock (Good Genes) only rarely manifest
    themselves in the same male. Provisioning and security potential are fantastic motivators for pairing with a Good Dad, but the same characteristics that make him such are generally a disadvantage
    when compared with the man who better exemplifies genetic, physical attraction and the risk taking qualities that would imbue her child with a better capacity to adapt to its environment (i.e
    stronger, faster, more attractive than others to ensure the passing of her own genetic material to future generations). This is the Jerk vs. Nice Guy paradox writ large on an evolutionary scale.
  </p>
  <p>Men and women innately (though unconsciously) understand this dynamic, so in order for a woman to have the best that the Good Dad has to offer while taking advantage of the best that the Good
    Genes man has, she must invent and constantly modify social conventions to keep the advantage in her biological favor.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Reproductive Schedules</strong><br /> This paradox then necessitates that women (and by default men) must subscribe to short term and long term schedules of mating. Short term schedules
    facilitate breeding with the Good Genes male, while long term breeding is reserved the Good Dad male. This convention and the psycho-social schemas that accompany it are precisely why women will
    marry the Nice Guy, stable, loyal, (preferably) doctor and still fuck the pool boy or the cute surfer she met on spring break. In our genetic past, a male with good genes implied an ability to be
    a good provider, but modern convention has thwarted this, so new social and mental schemas had to be developed for women.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cheating</strong><br /> For this dynamic and the practicality of enjoying the best of both genetic worlds, women find it necessary to &#8216;cheat&#8217;. This cheating can be done
    proactively or reactively.
  </p>
  <p>In the reactive model, a woman who has already paired with her long term partner choice, engages in a extramarital or extra-pairing, sexual intercourse with a short term partner (i.e. the
    cheating wife or girlfriend). That&#8217;s not to say this short term opportunity cannot develop into a 2nd, long term mate, but the action of infidelity itself is a method for securing better
    genetic stock than the committed male provider is capable of supplying.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Proactive cheating</strong> is the single Mommy dilema. This form of &#8216;cheating&#8217; relies on the woman breeding with a Good Genes male, bearing his children and then abandoning
    him, or having him abandon her, (again through invented social conventions) in order to find a Good Dad male to provide for her and the children of her Good Genes partner to ensure their security.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to stress again that (most) women do not have some consciously constructed and recognized master plan to enact this cycle and deliberately trap men into it. Rather, the motivations for this
    behavior and the accompanying social rationales invented to justify it are an unconscious process. For the most part, women are unaware of this dynamic, but are nonetheless subject to its
    influence. <strong><em>For a female of any species to facilitate a methodology for breeding with the best genetic partner she&#8217;s able to attract AND to ensure her own and her
        offspring&#8217;s survival with the best provisioning partner; this is an evolutionary jackpot</em></strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The Cuckold</strong><br /> On some level of consciousness, men innately sense something is wrong with this situation, though they may not be able to place why they feel it or
    misunderstand it in the confusion of women&#8217;s justifications for it. Or they become frustrated by the social pressures to &#8216;do the right thing&#8217;, are shamed into
    martyrdom/savior-hood and committed to a feigned responsibility to these conventions. Nevertheless, some see it well enough to steer clear of single mothers, either by prior experience or
    observing other male cuckolds saddled with the responsibility of raising and providing for &#8211; no matter how involved or uninvolved &#8211; another man&#8217;s successful reproduction efforts
    with this woman.
  </p>
  <p>Men often fall into the role of the proactive or reactive Cuckold. He will never enjoy the same benefits as his mates short term partner(s) to the same degree, in the way of sexual desire or
    immediacy of it, while at the same time enduring the social pressures of having to provide for this Good Genes father&#8217;s progeny. It could be argued that he may contribute minimally to their
    welfare, but on some level, whether emotional, physical, financial or educational he will contribute some effort for another man&#8217;s genetic stock in exchange for a limited form of
    sexuality/intimacy from the mother. To some degree, (even if only by his presence) he is sharing the parental investment that should be borne by the short term partner. If nothing else, he
    contributes the time and effort to her he could be better invested in finding a sexual partner with which he could pursue his own genetic imperative by his own methodology.</p>
  <p>However, needless to say, there is no shortage of men sexually deprived enough to &#8216;see past&#8217; the long term disadvantages, and not only rewarding, but reinforcing a single
    mother&#8217;s bad decisions (bad from his own interest&#8217;s POV) with regard to her breeding selections and schedules in exchange for short term sexual gratification. Furthermore, by
    reinforcing her behavior thusly, he reinforces the social convention for both men and women. It&#8217;s important to bear in mind that in this age women are ultimately, soley responsible for the
    men they choose to mate with (baring rape of course) AND giving birth to their children. Men do bear responsibility for their actions no doubt, but it is ultimately the decision of the female and
    her judgement that decides her and her children&#8217;s fate</p>
</div>
<h1>BUFFERS</h1>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>
    <strong>Rejection is better than Regret</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>Sifting through some of my past posts on the SoSuave forum it hit me; over 90% of what I advocate there can be reduced to overcoming a fear of rejection. 90% of the dilemas AFCs and rAFCs
    find themselves in, and a majority of men&#8217;s concerns, with the opposite sex find their roots in the methods and means they use to reduce their exposure to female rejection. These are buffers
    meant to reduce the potential for this rejection of intimacy. Men of course aren&#8217;t the only ones who use buffers &#8211; women have their share as well &#8211; but I think it would be much
    more productive for guys to recognize this propensity in themselves and see the methods they use, and often ego-invest in their personal psychologies, to buffer themselves against rejection.</p>
  <p>
    Virtually every common problem guys deal with finds it&#8217;s basis in these buffers:<br /> <strong>LDRs &#8211;</strong> Long Distance Relationships. The AFC will entertain an LDR because it
    was based on a previous acceptance of intimacy and being no longer convenient (due to distance) the guy will cling to the &#8220;relationship&#8221; because it&#8217;s a buffer against potential
    rejection from new women instead of accepting the relationship as being finished and maturely re-entering the dating pool. It&#8217;s a perceived &#8220;sure thing&#8221;, even if only rarely
    rewarding.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Playing Friends &#8211;</strong> Usually after an LJBF rejection where the perception is the potential love interest &#8220;might&#8221; later become an intimate with time and
    qualification. No matter how misguided, the time and effort spent by an AFC in proving himself as the would-be &#8220;perfect boyfriend&#8221; is a buffer against further rejection by new
    potential females, which is then further compounded by a moralistic sense of duty to be an actual Friend to his LJBF girl. In essence, his buffer against further rejection is his misplaced
    dedication to the LJBF girl. Another variation of this is the Cap&#8217;n-Save-A-Ho dynamic.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Emails, IMs and Texts &#8211;</strong> I should also add lengthy phone conversations to this list as well, but really any technology that seemingly increases comunication serves as a
    buffer (for both genders) the more it limits interpersonal communication. In the AFC case, the rationalization is that it keeps him in constant contact with his sex interest (which in and of
    itself is a mistake), but only serves as a buffer against her rejection. The latent peception being that it&#8217;s easier to read a rejection (or hear one) than to potentially be rejected in
    person. A lot of guys will counter this with how Texts and IM&#8217;s are just how this generation plies it&#8217;s Game. The difference I&#8217;d argue is that when digital communication becomes
    your <em>preferred</em> method of interacting with women, it&#8217;s a buffer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Facebook &amp; Online Dating &#8211;</strong> This one should be fairly obvious for the same reasons as above &#8211; Online dating is perhaps the best buffer ever conceived &#8211;
    particularly for less than physically ideal women. In fact it&#8217;s so effective that businesses can be built upon the common insecurities and fear of rejection of both sexes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Objectification of Gender &#8211; </strong>This might be less obvious, but both sexes tend to objectify the other. Naturally when we think of this, the popularized notion is that men
    objectify women as sex objects, but women have a tendency to objectify men as &#8220;success objects&#8221; for the same reason. It is easier to accept rejection from an object than it is to take
    it from a living, breathing, human being. This is why we refer to intergender communication as a &#8220;game.&#8221; We &#8220;score&#8221; or we get &#8220;shot down&#8221; not personally or
    emotionally rejected; the buffer is in the language and mental approach.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Idealization of Gender &#8211;</strong> This is the myth of the &#8220;Quality Woman.&#8221; The buffer operates in perceived self-limitations based on a search for an ideal mate. Thus a
    tendency to fixate on one woman (ONEitis) or one type of woman (a gender Archetype) develops. By limiting to, and/or fixating on one woman (or type) the potential for rejection decreases, while
    insuring that any real rejection will come only from what will later be deemed non-qualified women. Rejection = &#8216;Low Quality Woman&#8217; and is thus disqualified. This works in a similar
    fashon to the objectification buffer in that the woman delivering the rejection is reduced to an object.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Scarcity Mentality &#8211;</strong> The &#8220;Take What I Can Get and Be Glad I Got It&#8221; mentality acts as a buffer in that it works opposite of the Idealization buffer. Deprivation
    is motivation, and by sticking with the &#8220;sure thing&#8221; as the &#8220;only thing&#8221;, the potential for new rejection is then eliminated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Older Women, Younger Women &#8211; </strong>I should also include certain body types in this category as well, but the buffer is in certain types of women being less likely to reject a man
    due to their personal circumstances. The Cougar dynamic debate has been done into irrelevancy, but the buffer is that older women, acting in accordance with their conditions, will be more inclined
    to accept the advances of younger men. In the same vein, very young girls will be more apt to accept the advances of older men due to naiveté and fat women are easier to become intimate with due
    to sexual deprivation. This isn&#8217;t rocket science, but an internalized preference for particular women develop by associating that particular type of woman with the minimization for potential
    rejection.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Leagues</strong> &#8211; This is the opposite of a &#8220;high standards&#8221; buffer which could be grouped with Scarcity. There is the woman some guys actually fear because she is
    perceived to be so much more socially valuable than the AFC. Think of the HB9+ corporate director who runs marathons, travels a lot, has good friends, dresses well, etc, etc, etc. The AFC tells
    himself &#8220;wow is she out of my league I would just get shot down because I would need to possess A, B &amp; C to be her social status equal for her to even be interested&#8221;. Ergo, the
    idea of Leagues is a useful rationalization buffer against rejection.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Pornography</strong> I realize this will draw some fire from the masturbation / no-masturbation set, but porn (as men use it) is a Buffer against rejection. Porn doesn&#8217;t talk back,
    porn doesn&#8217;t need a few drinks to loosen up nor does porn require any social skills to produce rewards. It&#8217;s convenient, immediate, sexual release that requires nothing more than a PC
    and an internet connection (or a magazine if you prefer the analog means). We can argue the obsessive-compulsive aspect of it, or the &#8220;my GF and I enjoy porn together&#8221; reasoning, but
    for the single guy the root reasoning is it&#8217;s facility as a Buffer. I should also add that it&#8217;s this very facility that makes women hate it (when they do). Porn gives a guy his reward
    for free; a reward that should be her single best agency is rendered valueless when a man can get off to an infinite variety of sexual experience at the click of a mouse. It&#8217;s unlimited
    access to unlimited sexual availability without the stress of learning methods to earn it as a reward.
  </p>
  <p>These are really just a few notable examples, but once you become aware of how buffers manifest you&#8217;ll begin to see how and why they are useful against rejection. Buffers are generally
    the paths of least rejection that become ego-invested &#8220;preferences.&#8221; Buffers aren&#8217;t so much about those &#8220;preference&#8221; as they are about the motivations behind them.</p>
  <p>
    At this point you might be thinking, &#8220;well, what the hell, I don&#8217;t want to feel rejection, why not employ buffers against it?&#8221; The main reason for embracing rejection is that <strong>rejection
      is better than regret</strong>. Scan back through this short list of buffers; how many of these have become greater, longer term problems for you than a briefly painful rejection would&#8217;ve been?
    Buffers also have a tendency to compound upon themselves in that one tends to dovetail into another, or more, until you no longer realize that they were originally rejection prevention
    methodologies and gradually become associated with your genuine personality. After a long enough period, these buffer become &#8220;just how I am.&#8221;
  </p>
  <p>Lastly, experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best. Rejection, real, raw, in your face rejection stings like a bitch. It must be something so intolerable that human beings will devise
    countless social and psychological constructs in order to avoid it. However, there is no better teacher than getting burned by the stove. As a Man, you are going to face rejection in far more
    facets of your life than just dealing with a woman. The buffers you learn in one aspect of your life will be just as encumbering when they&#8217;re transferred to another aspect of your life. All
    of these buffers listed, and many more, become indicators of how you confidently deal with adversity. Some make you look like a beta-herb pussy, others are subtle and nagging parts of an
    internalized personality, but dependence upon them incrementally reveals your real character to a woman. Are you Alpha enough to take a rejection on the chin, smile and confidently come back for
    more? Or will you run, will you block yourself, will you hide with convenient buffers?</p>

<h1>IMAGINATION</h1>

<div id="post_message_1700798">
  A woman&#8217;s imagination is the single most useful tool in your Game arsenal. Every technique, every casual response, every gesture, intimation and subcommunication hinges on stimulating her
  imagination. Competition anxiety relies on it. DHV relies on it. Sexual tension (gina tingles) relies on it. Call it &#8220;Caffeinating the Hamster&#8221; if you will, but stimulating a
  woman&#8217;s imaginings is the single most potent talent you can learn in any context of a relationship (LTR, STR, ONS, Plate Spinning.)
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the single greatest failing of average frustrated chumps; they vomit out everything about themselves, divulging the full truth of themselves to women in the mistaken belief that women
    desire that truth as a basis for qualifying for their intimacy. Learn this now: <strong>Women NEVER want full disclosure</strong>. Nothing is more self-satisfying for a woman than to think
    she&#8217;s figured a Man out based solely on her mythical feminine intuition (i.e. imagination).
  </p>
  <p>When a man overtly confirms his character, his story, his value, etc. for a woman, the mystery is dispelled and the bio-chemical rush she enjoyed from her imaginings, her suspicions, her
    self-confirmations about you are GONE. AFCs classically do exactly this on the first date and wonder why they get LJBF&#8217;d promptly after it &#8211; this is why. Familiarity is anti-seductive.
    Nothing kills Game, lust and libido like comfortable familiarity. Despite their common bleating filibuster tactics, women don&#8217;t want to be comfortable with a potential (or proven) sex
    partner, they need their imaginations stoked to be excited, aroused and anxious to want sex with a potential partner.</p>
</div>
<div>
  In an LTR there&#8217;s an even more critical need to keep prodding that imagination. I would go so far as to say it&#8217;s imperative for a healthy relationship, but then you&#8217;ll ask, how do
  you go about that when your LTR GF or wife already knows your story and the familiarity becomes cemented in?
  </p>
  <p>
    The easy answer is never let it be from the outset &#8211; <strong>the health of any LTR you might entertain depends and survives on the frame you enter into it with</strong>. The foundations of a
    healthy LTR are laid while you&#8217;re single and dating non-exclusively. I&#8217;ve yet to meet the guy who&#8217;s told me he&#8217;s getting more frequent, more intense sex <em>after</em> his
    LTR / Marriage / Live-in situation was established. The primary reason for this is the relaxation of the competition anxiety that made the urgency of fucking you with lustful abandon in your
    dating phase an imperative to get you to commit to her frame. And that&#8217;s the crux of the matter that so many guys fail in, they surrender the frame BEFORE they commit to an LTR. They
    believe, (thanks to their Matrix conditioning) that commitment is synonymous with acquiescing to her frame control. Combine this with anti-seductive familiarity and the growing commonness of your
    own value because of it, and you can see exactly why her sexual interest wanes.
  </p>
  <p>So what do you do to prevent that? First and foremost, understand that whose frame you enter into an LTR sets the foundation of that LTR. If you find yourself buying into an &#8220;it&#8217;s
    women&#8217;s world and we just live in it&#8221; mentality where your default presumption is that commitment means she wins, you lose and that&#8217;s just how it is, don&#8217;t even consider an
    LTR. She enters your world, not the other way around.</p>
  <p>
    Secondly, you need to cultivate an element of unpredictability about yourself prior to, and into, an LTR. Always remember POOK&#8217;s proverb, <strong>Perfect is BORING.</strong> Women will cry a
    river about wanting Mr. Dependable and then go off to fuck Mr. Exciting. In an LTR it&#8217;s necessary to be both, but not one at the expense of the other. Too many married men are TERRIFIED to
    rock the excitement boat with their wives because their sex lives hang in the balance of placating to her and her already preset frame. She must be reminded daily why you&#8217;re fun,
    unpredictable and exciting, not only to her, but other women as well. This requires covertly implying that other women find you desirable. Women crave the chemical rush that comes from suspicion
    and indignation. If you don&#8217;t provide it, they&#8217;ll happily get it from tabloids, romance novels, The View, Tyra Banks or otherwise living vicariously through their single girlfriends.
  </p>
  <p>By playfully staying her source of that rush you maintain the position of stimulating her imagination. Married men, who were defeated before they committed, don&#8217;t think that elements of
    Game apply to marriage out of fear of upsetting their wives frame, when in fact C&amp;F and Negs and many other aspects of Game work wonderfully. Just kicking her in the ass or busting her chops,
    playfully, is sometimes enough to send the message that you&#8217;re fearless of her response. You can break her frame with cockiness and the imaginings that come with it.</p>
  <p>Breaking from an established, predictable familiarity is often a great way to fire her imagination. Married guys will report how sexual their wives become after they get to the gym and start
    shaping up after a long layoff (or for the first time). It&#8217;s easy to pass this off as looking better makes women more aroused (which is true), but underneath that is the breaking of a
    pattern. You&#8217;re controllable and predictable so long as you&#8217;re pudgy and listless &#8211; what other woman would want you? But start changing your patterns, get into shape, make more
    money, get a promotion, improve and demonstrate your higher value in some appreciable way and the imagination and competition anxiety returns.</p>

<h1>SOCIAL MATCHING THEORY</h1>
<img src="img/books/red2.jpeg">
<p>
  <em>How to spot a rich guy</em>
</p>
<p>We laugh our asses off at this joke, but why is it funny? It is funny because human beings, like many other higher order animals, have the innate ability to make cognitive comparisons on a
  subconscious level. The reason it&#8217;s humorous is because we see an imbalance in a system and make deductive conclusions with regard to individual conditions. This is the basis of the Social
  Matching Theory.</p>
<p>
  Social Matching Theory, in essence, is defined as follows: <em>All things being equal, an individual will tend to be attracted to, and are more likely to pair off with, another individual who
    is of the same or like degree of physical attractiveness as themself.</em>
</p>
<p>Just as an aside, this is a well recognized social psychology theory, not something manufactured by Game theorists. However, in a nutshell it outlines the sexual marketplace dynamic, before
  adding variables like Game, status, provisioning, etc.</p>
<p>This is a naturally occuring commonality among many specific aculturations and societies. The trick to this theory is of course that &#8216;All Things&#8217; are rarely equal. However, my point
  to this isn&#8217;t to naively assume that attraction and sexual pairing happen in a vacuum &#8211; far from it. It is to illustrate an underlying psycho-biological principle that operates beneath
  our consciousness that prompts other psychological schemas from an intimately personal (micro) level to the social psychology of an entire (macro) culture.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve posted in several forum threads with regard to &#8220;Why Women Cheat&#8221; or why men are so compelled toward sex with archetypically attractive women, the root of this desire
  is a psychologically evolved opportunism that is founded on our ability to make and assess these natural comparissons in order to better facilitate our own survival and the survival of our
  offspring. It has served our species so well over millennia that this natural comparisson making capacity has become an autonomous and subconscious aspect of experiencing our environment. We
  understand that eating a large apple is preferable, from a survial standpoint, to eating the small one. We have a tendency to want what our biologies compel us towards and develop idealizations
  based on what we think would best satisfy these ends.</p>
<p>As I stated, I understand that attraction and intersexual relations do not happen in a vacumm and there are many (generally predictable) variables that influence this, but Social Matching
  Theory isn&#8217;t about the process of attraction or pairing so much as the motivations for selection. I&#8217;m often asked about the importance placed on physical appearance, prowess, etc.
  bearing influence on attraction, and I can speak from my own experience saying yes, it absolutely does. A fat guy is simply not going to attract a Fitness America competitor without some very unique
  circumstances influencing this attraction. Neither would I support this attraction being based in a qualitative, genuine physical desire for the fat male. It is an imbalance in a system.</p>
<p>All things being equal; socio-economic, intellectual, emotional levels etc. you will have a tendency to attract and be attracted to people of similar physical presence as yourself. This is the
  root of the psychological schema many men and women apply when they follow the &#8220;He/She&#8217;s out of my leauge&#8221; mentality. They are manifesting this subconscious understanding that the
  prospects of another person of a more idealized physical presence being attracted to them or pairing with them would be an unlikely match. They self-perceive this imbalance and thus limit themselves
  to opportunities that have a better likelihood of success in gratifying their need &#8211; in this case sex.</p>
<p>Look at the &#8216;Rich Guy&#8217; picture again. The woman in this imbalance we might presume is a &#8216;Golddigger&#8217;. This too is inspired by an innate understanding of the Social
  Matching Theory. Why else would an (arguably) attractive woman in comparatively good shape, wearing a thong (indicating sexual availability), be with a morbidly obese male if he didn&#8217;t posess
  some other redeeming variable to inspire the match? We see a picture and laugh, and women make the internalized rationalization that she&#8217;s not genuinely interested in the guy, but is &#8216;in
  love&#8217; with his provisioning means. Superficial? Perhaps, but it still illustrates this comparative instinct we have, particularly when we know nothing about individual circumstance. The
  possibility does exists that this woman genuinely loves the guy, or is attracted to him, but this isn&#8217;t our first impression. In fact it takes significant, trained, mental effort to consider
  the possibility because the Social Matching comparison IS our natural default.</p>
<p>Finally, I should add that the Social Matching Theory is also one of the primary foundations upon which AFCism and ONEitis is based. This natural fear of rejection associated with both of these
  schema stem from a subconscious understanding of this theory. ONEitis in particular can be traced back to this self-perception of imbalance leading to the &#8220;I&#8217;ll never find a better
  woman/man than this person&#8221; mentality in so much as it represents a limitation of opportunism. In other words, it becomes preferable for a person to stay and accomodate an otherwise
  intolerable relationship if that person has internalized the understanding that their relationship represents an imbalance in this Social Matching. Abuse endured from the more idealized mate becomes
  preferable to rejection from anonymous, less idealized sources of intimacy.</p>
<p>At this point you may be wondering what brought this post to the surface. I recently got into a debate with a self-described feminist who entirely rejected notion that a sexual marketplace
  should even exist in contemporary human society. It wasn&#8217;t that she was denying the underlying dynamic of the sexual marketplace, but rather that it was an antiquated and dehumanizing
  influence in the human condition. Up until this conversation, I&#8217;d always taken the idea of a sexual marketplace and sexual market value as applied to individuals as a given. The SMP was a
  recognized universal framework in which we maneuver &#8211; some successfully, others with difficulty. The rejection of this idea, or the desire to alter it sociological, seems absurd to me, even
  though I would agree that it is a brutal game we play. My counterargument with her was that the SMP is actually more representative of our humanity, in that it&#8217;s healthier to accept that the
  way we evolved as a successful species was due to the harsh reality of the SMP. She wouldn&#8217;t hear it.</p>

<h1>ALPHA</h1>
<iframe width="620" height="379" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xc0CB6URrV0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
  <em>The Alpha Buddah, Corey Worthington.</em>
</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m about to type here is not going to make me any new friends. I know because any discussion of what constitutes Alpha characteristics in a Man always becomes clouded by the
  self-perceptions of how well we think we align with them. As I&#8217;ve covered in prior postings, the &#8216;community&#8217;, the &#8216;manosphere&#8217;, the new understanding of gender
  relations that&#8217;s picked up momentum for the last 12 years has always generated it&#8217;s own terminologies for more abstract concepts. The danger in this is that these terms lack real,
  universal definition. For purposes of illustrating a concept these terms are usually serviceable – we have a general understanding of what makes for a &#8216;Beta&#8217; or a Herb, or a man who
  falls into a &#8216;provider&#8217; mentality. Even &#8216;Alpha&#8217; in a specific context is useful as an illustrative tool, when the subject isn&#8217;t directly about &#8216;Alpha-ness&#8217;.
  It&#8217;s when we try to universally define what constitutes Alpha that the sparks start to fly. So before you continue on reading further, think about what you believe makes a guy Alpha. Got it in
  your head now? Good, now put all of that aside, purge that from your head, and read the next few paragraphs from the perspective that you don&#8217;t know anything about Alpha.</p>
<p>
  I was first introduced to the Alpha Buddah courtesy of Roissy and this post <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/umm-sorry/">&#8220;Umm, sorry?&#8221;</a> You can go ahead and read
  this from the Chateau&#8217;s perspective, and I think the analysis is pretty good. I call Corey the Alpha Buddah not in the hopes that men will aspire to his almost Zen like &#8216;being&#8217; in
  Alpha, but rather to provide an example of Alpha in it&#8217;s most pure form. He literally IS Alpha, unclouded by pretense, afterthought, or conscious awareness of any influence that could have a
  hope of prompting introspection about his state.
</p>
<p>Corey Worthington is a piss poor example of a human being, but he&#8217;s a textbook example of Alpha. I could use a lot of adjectives to describe this kid, but &#8220;beta&#8221;
  wouldn&#8217;t be one of them. What&#8217;s funny, and a bit ironic, is this kid has probably never come across Mystery Method or &#8220;the community&#8221; or even heard of
  &#8216;peacocking&#8217; and he gets naturally what millions of guys pay small fortunes at PUA seminars to acquire over the course of a lifetime. He&#8217;s a selfish little prick, but what makes
  him insulting to &#8216;normal&#8217; men is his having the natural, internalized Alpha bravado so many AFCs wish they had. If you could bottle and sell this Alpha essence, you&#8217;d be rich
  beyond imagine.</p>
<p>Right about now all of those self-affirming preconceptions you had about Alpha-ness (that I told you to stow away before reading this) are probably yelling to be let out of the mental box you
  put them in. &#8220;,..but, but Rollo, how can you possibly think this arrogant douchebag kid could ever be an example of anything remotely Alpha?!&#8221; You&#8217;ll be pleased to know I fully
  empathize your outrage. You work hard to be a &#8220;better man&#8221;, you put in the self analysis, you paid your dues coming to terms with unplugging and reinventing yourself. You&#8217;re a
  success, Corey is fuck-up. Corey&#8217;s not a better Man than you are, however, he understands Alpha better than you do.</p>
<p>Alpha is mindset, not a demographic.</p>
<p>Alpha is as Alpha does, it isn&#8217;t what we say it is. There are noble Alphas and there are scoundrel Alphas, the difference is all in how they apply themselves. There&#8217;s a tendency to
  approach every &#8220;Alpha&#8221; argument from what a guy thinks is righteousness; ergo, his personal definition of Alpha is what appeals best to his sense of virtue. He earned his Alpha cred,
  played by the rules, and by God people (women) should respect that. However, the sad truth is that prisons are full of Alpha males who simply channeled their drive toward destructive and anti-social
  endeavors. There are plenty of examples of indifferent Asshole Alphas who you wouldn&#8217;t say are upstanding moral leaders at all, yet women will literally kill each other (or themselves) in
  order to bang them because they exude a natural Alpha-ness. Just as Corey does here. There are Alpha drug dealing gang leaders, and there are Alpha husbands, fathers and leaders of industry.
  It&#8217;s all in the application. Genghis Khan was Alpha as fuck, and a leader-of-men, but probably would be on most people&#8217;s douchebag list for that era. Here&#8217;s an illustration:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guy&#8217;s like Corey infuriate men who have invested their self-worth in the accomplishments of what they think ought to be universally appreciated and rewarded. So when they&#8217;re
  confronted with a natural Alpha being undeservedly rewarded for brazenly acting out of accord with what they think the rules ought to be, they seethe with resentment. The natural response in the
  face of such an inconsistency is to redefine the term &#8216;Alpha&#8217; to cater to themselves and their accomplishments as &#8220;real men&#8221; and exclude the perpetrator. The conflict then
  comes from seeing his new definition of Alpha not being rewarded or even appreciated as well as a natural Alpha attitude and the cycle continues. Your respect (or anyone else&#8217;s) for an Alpha
  has nothing to do with whether or not he possess an Alpha mindset. 3 failed marriages and 100+ lays has nothing to do with his having or not having an Alpha mindset. There are many well respected
  betas who&#8217;ve never had a passing thought of infidelity, or may have 300 lays either with prostitutes or because they possess fame or stunning good looks and women come to him by matter of
  course.</p>
<p>The take home message here is that you are not Alpha because of your achievements, you have your achievements because you are Alpha. You possess a mindset you either had to develop or it came
  naturally to you. I constantly field questions from young men asking me whether some action or behavior they displayed to a woman was Alpha, or Alpha enough. The real answer is that Alpha behaviors
  are manifestations of an Alpha mindset. And just like Corey the Alpha Buddah, the introspect required to wonder if something was or wasn&#8217;t Alpha wouldn&#8217;t ever be a consideration enough
  to ask. You almost need to have a childlike understanding to really appreciate what Alpha really is. Kids get Alpha. Even the picked on, introverted, beta-to-be kid has a better understanding of
  Alpha than most adult men do because he lacks the abstract thinking required to rationalize Alpha for himself. Most men, by our socialization, and to varying degrees, lose this in-born Alpha mindset
  over time. The naturals, the Corey&#8217;s of the world, have a better grasp on it&#8217;s usefulness and repurpose it; either to their adulthood advantage or their detriment.</p>

  <strong>Spin more plates.</strong>
</p>
<p>A lot of people get confused when I use this analogy and I thought it prudent to write a post on just what I mean in this regard.</p>
<p>
  A Man needs to have a lot of simultaneous prospects spinning together. Think of each plate as a separate woman you are pursuing. Some fall off and break, others you may wish to stop spinning
  altogether and some may not spin as fast as you&#8217;d like, but the essence of plate theory is that <strong>a man is as confident and valuable as his options. </strong>This is the essence of the
  abundance mindset &#8211; confidence is derived from options.
</p>
<p>
  This principle is the key to solving so many of the problems that dog the heels of beta AFCs and recovering AFCs. In fact I would say that this ideology should be the cornerstone to success for a
  man in many facets of life, not simply attracting and keeping women. <strong>A man with options has power, and from these options and this sense of power, a natural sense of confidence will
    manifest itself.</strong> A man without options becomes <em>necessitous</em> and this leads to a lack of confidence and a scarcity mentality. Necessitous men are never free.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/the-cardinal-rule-of-relationships/" target="_blank">The Cardinal Rule of Relationships<br />
  </a><em>In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.</em>
</p>
<p>When a man spins more plates, when he has irons in the fire, when he is pursuing multiple women simultaneously, when he has options equally worth exploring, a man will have a natural,
  subconscious (but not exclusively) understanding that if one prospect does not expand, others very well may. This understanding has manifestations in a man&#8217;s behavior that women key on
  covertly. There are mannerisms and attitudes that a man with options will subconsciously convey to prospective women that they interpret, and give this man a value as a commodity to be competed for
  with other females.</p>
<p>On various sites in the PUA community, men are taught to emulate this behavior since it is a key element in attraction and interest. Cocky-Funny is one such technique that trains a confidence
  behavior that (more often than not) essentially masks a deficit of options. In other words, C&amp;F is a natural behavior for men with options that must be compensated for by those who don&#8217;t
  have an apptitude for it. This is why the &#8216;natural&#8217; Alpha male seems to exude C&amp;F effortlessly while those without the benefit of more plates spinning (or the confidence in the
  ability of spinning more) struggle with simple things like eye contact or initiating approaches. This is also a fundamental principle in the &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a fuck&#8221; mentality that
  pervades community technique &#8211; it&#8217;s much easier to actually not &#8220;give a fuck&#8221; if you have other prospects going simultaneously.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Shotgun Logic</strong>
</p>
<p>One very important benefit that Plate Theory provides for a man is that it greatly curbs the propensity for ONEitis both in and out of an LTR.</p>
<p>
  Outside of an LTR, most guys subscribe to what I call the <em>Sniper</em> mentality. This is the AFC that applies all of his time, effort and resources to patiently waiting out his target, waiting
  for that perfect opportunity to summon enough courage in the most precise of conditions to take his one shot at the girl, who by then is the focus of his ONEitis. This process can take anywhere from
  a few weeks to a few years in extreme cases, but all the while he voluntarily sacrifices his most valuable of resource &#8211; potential opportunity. The man who subscribes to Plate Theory can more
  easily avoid this situation as he goes hunting for women with a <em>Shotgun</em>; scattering as much influence across the broadest area possible. While the AFC fishes with a single line and a single
  hook, the Plate Theorist fishes with a trolling net, selecting the fish worth keeping and tossing back those who aren&#8217;t.
</p>
<p>Inside an LTR, Plate Theory becomes more specified. The AFC placates and identifies with his partner because the balance has shifted to her advantage since he reinforces her understanding that
  she is his only source of intimacy. I can&#8217;t think of a better recipe for ONEitis since he become progressively more dependent on her as his only source of intimacy. The man that maintains, at
  the very least, the covert perception of options, either professionally or on an intersexual level (i.e. social proof that other women will compete for him) maintains this power balance. Most
  successful men have an innate understanding of this and this explains their popular reservations for committing to marriage, In an LTR, Plate Theory becomes a subtle dance of perception and
  recognizing how your partner interprets understanding a particular man&#8217;s options, but regardless, it reduces a guy&#8217;s tendency to regress into ONEitis in an LTR from his own
  self-perception and the confidence int inspires.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Natural Selection</strong>
</p>
<p>
  As I illustrated in the fishing net analogy, spinning more plates allows you more opportunity to select from the largest pool of prospective choices and date them or drop them as you see fit. This
  has two benefits. First, it serves as valuable, though non-committed, experience for learning what a man requires for his own personal satisfaction. Experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best and
  the breadth of experience serves a man well. Who&#8217;s insight is more beneficial, the man who&#8217;s sailed the world over or the man who&#8217;s never ventured beyond a lake? Secondly, <strong>opportunity
    and options make a man the PRIZE</strong>. Rock stars, professional athletes and movie stars aren&#8217;t irresistible to women because of their celebrity, but because they blatantly, and with the highest
  form of social proof, prove they have options that other women will jealously compete for as well as the confidence that this unconscious knowledge naturally manifests itself in them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What Plate Theory is not</strong>
</p>
<p>My critics will often take a binary stance in their arguments with this idea citing that &#8220;they could never be with more than one woman at a time out of respect for her&#8221; or &#8220;so
  I should just lie to her and see other girls on the side?&#8221; To which I&#8217;d argue that these are feminized social conventions that attempt to thwart a man&#8217;s options in order to
  establish women as the prime selectors in intersexual relations. If it can be conditioned into a boy/man to &#8216;feel bad&#8217; about seeing more than one woman at a time, it only better serves
  the female-as-chooser dynamic. To be sure, women are naturally the filters for their own intimacies, but it is essentially men who do the sexual selection. These convention&#8217;s latent purpose
  are designed to put selection of intimacy on a conditional basis that favors women, and as long as men will internalize this women will have a pre-constructed social high-ground.</p>
<p>The way to circumvent this dynamic is brutal honesty and a commitment to truthful, non-exclusivity with the plates you&#8217;re spinning. If you keep your options above board and are honest
  with any one girl and yourself about your choice to be non-exclusive, you not only remove the teeth from this convention, but you also reinforce yourself as a man with options (or at least perceived
  options). Further, critics will offer &#8220;well gee, if I did that with any woman she&#8217;d push off and dump me&#8221; to which I&#8217;ll refute &#8211; not if you establish this honestly from
  the outset. Most guys who&#8217;ve swallowed the &#8216;female power&#8217; convention are too afraid or to preconditioned to even consider this as an option for seeing women. Letting a woman know,
  or covertly perceive, that you wont be exclusive to her pushes your commodity level up and implies options and potential success she&#8217;ll compete with other women to be associated with.</p>
<p>Plate Theory is also, most definitely not, a license to be indiscriminate with women. Just because you can spin a plate doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you should spin that plate. Some
  aren&#8217;t worth spinning and a man with options should have no reservation about letting one go for a better one or two. In fact a man ought to be more discriminating in this regard since it
  affords him the best available from the largest selection.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Plate Theory II:&nbsp;Non-Exclusivity</h1>

<p>
  <em>Women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled by a faithful loser.</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;I just started applying Plate Theory, and I have to say with all honesty that this is probably the best thing I&#8217;ve ever done in my entire life. The feeling of having options is
    addictive; the whole idea that you don&#8217;t come from a necessitous emotional state is genius, and in fact the more options you have, the more attractive you become to women (through the
    unconscious changes in your behavior), the more women become attracted to you, and the more options you have. Once you get it started, it&#8217;s hard to stop it.</p>
  <p>
    Recently I&#8217;ve been <a title="Plate Theory" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/plate-theory-2/">Spinning Plates</a> with some success, but there comes a point when I risk one
    girl finding out about another. How do I handle this without the risk of losing one of my plates? Should I even bother with the effort of spinning plates that aren&#8217;t as high a value as
    others?&#8221;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Real options are the cornerstone of confidence, so try not to think of it in terms of risk – as in you&#8217;re risking the loss of &#8220;a great girl&#8221;. Most guys get to a point where
  Game and plate spinning give them their first taste of real options to select from or fall back on when another doesn&#8217;t pan out. The problem arises when they spin enough plates successfully to
  the point where they think they&#8217;ve maxed out to their &#8220;best&#8221; option and the old scarcity mentality returns. Most times a guy who newly practices Game and plate spinning never
  really spins plates per se; he uses it for the first monogamous opportunity that&#8217;s been eluding him for so long and calls it quits. He never actualizes and internalizes an abundance mentality.</p>
<p>Spinning Plates doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;re fucking all of your plates. It&#8217;s more of a spreading out of your efforts across a wider pool of subjects. Some will
  reciprocate, and those you entertain. Others will not, or prove to be less desirable, and those you let fall. This isn&#8217;t as difficult as it sounds once you&#8217;ve established your own
  resolve to be non-exclusive. At some point women will attempt to corner you into exclusivity and this is where your resolve will be tested. Women love to say how they have Rules, well you must have
  Rules as well. This means not shacking up with a woman, not slipping into any routine with her, not calling her more than necessary to set up another sporadic date, saving your weekends for women
  who&#8217;ve had a proven IL in you (i.e. sex or intimacy) and relegating those who haven&#8217;t to Tuesdays &amp; Wednesdays, etc. This may seem like a lot of micromanagement, but once you put it
  into practice in as pragmatic a way possible to accomodate your life you&#8217;ll find that the decisions you make regarding the plates you are choosing to spin will become automatic.</p>
<p>
  If you feel that you have something to lose with a particular girl, you&#8217;re no longer spinning plates &#8211; you&#8217;re thinking and approaching dating in terms of exclusivity. POOK&#8217;s
  great quote: &#8220;women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled by a faithful loser&#8221; A lot of guys (and almost every woman) have a big problem with the truth of this because they
  take it too literally. POOK was never suggesting that you <strong>overtly</strong> declare that you&#8217;ll be open to other options and that your girls should consciously be expected to accept
  this. Every woman takes this quote in this way, and with good reason because they don&#8217;t want to seem like an easy mark. When it&#8217;s on the table like that it unsurprisingly becomes an
  affront to their pride and self-worth. However, in practice, non-exclusivity has to be <strong>covert</strong>. It needs to be implied, not declared. Thus you see the truth in POOK&#8217;s
  observation &#8211; women&#8217;s behavior will bear him out. <a title="Imagination" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/imagination/">Imagination</a> and competition anxiety paired
  with implied non-exclusivity are the tools for successful plate spinning.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Become the commodity she&#8217;s looking for.</strong>
</p>
<p>A high value Man can spin plates, and sometimes those plates suspect there are, or know there are other plates in his rotation. They&#8217;ll tolerate it so long as he remains high enough value
  (or effectively presents that perception) or hypergamy wil move them along to another high value Man. As I state in Plate Theory, some plates fall off to be replaced by new plates. You must be
  willing and confident enough to let some of them fall. This is a tough reality for recovering chumps new to Game to accept. Deprivation has conditioned them to hang onto a &#8220;sure thing&#8221;
  and this becomes all the more difficult when the plate they happen to drop was the first woman they&#8217;d ever successfully applied Game to, or was hotter than any girl they&#8217;d previously
  been with.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, you don&#8217;t have to be sexual with every one of the plates you&#8217;re spinning (this used to be called &#8220;dating&#8221; in the days before serial monogamy became
  the fashion). It&#8217;s the potential in knowing that you could be, or that there are women who will value your attention that prompts a competitive anxiety in women &#8211; often when you
  don&#8217;t even know you&#8217;re doing it. If you are sexual with some of the plates you&#8217;re spinning, so much the better since you know that they&#8217;re proven commodities and if one
  isn&#8217;t performing as you&#8217;d like, you have the unconscious knowledge that others will, or you have the proven ability to generate more options for yourself.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Monogamy is a byproduct, not a goal.</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles guys have with Plate Theory is breaking themselves of this &#8216;LTR-as-Goal&#8217; mentality. Obviously I&#8217;m not anti-monogamy, however monogamy should never
  be a goal, it should be a by-product of Plate Theory, but only when you&#8217;ve properly filtered through enough plates to understand how options play into confidence and controlling the frame. If
  a woman is unwilling to be non-exclusive with you (i.e. &#8220;she&#8217;ll leave me if I see other girls&#8221; fear) she isn&#8217;t a plate to spin. This seems counterintuitive to a guy with an
  LTR-As-Goal mentality and it is, but the guy who can fearlessly, and honestly stay above-board with his intent is the one who&#8217;ll be spinning more plates. Most guys (AFCs in particular) are
  deathly afraid of losing that ONE perfect girl and so never even attempt to spin more than one plate, much less have any others to compare her &#8216;perfection&#8217; to in the first place.
  I&#8217;ve even seen PUAs do exactly this. They&#8217;re so impressed with the success of newly perfected techniques that they settle for the ONE &#8216;dream girl&#8217; and find that their
  attentions become valueless to her because she perceives she is his only option for intimacy, his script gets flipped on him, and he gets marginalized. It&#8217;s not a failure in technique, but
  rather a failure in his mindset.</p>
<p>So what do you do to establish your plates and be truly, and successfully, non-exclusive with women? Initially I&#8217;d suggest doing exactly what most women have perfected for the better part
  of their lifetimes, stay intentionally ambiguous. Women practice Plate Theory by default &#8211; they play the Coquette (hard to get), they know how to be ambiguous enough to keep their options
  open, but not so much as to let a guy&#8217;s interest fail. They naturally know that we only chase what runs away from us. They never commit fully, but still keep the carrot in front of the donkey.</p>
<p>Women communicate COVERTLY, with gesture, with looks, with veiled meanings &#8211; you have to communicate your intent to be non-exclusive COVERTLY. Never OVERTLY tell a woman you&#8217;ve got
  other plates than her spinning. Allow her to discover this by your mannerisms, your behaviors, and definitely by your availability to her. Create value through scarcity, don&#8217;t be so available
  to her, but just enough to keep her interest and allow her mind to consider that maybe you have other options. Even when you don&#8217;t, fomenting this anxiety is a VERY useful tool for you while
  you do get more plates to spin. Even the ambient confidence that comes from knowing you have a past, proven, ability to generate more sexual options for yourself will manifest itself in your
  personality and trigger this competition anxiety.</p>
<p>At some point a woman will resort to OVERT communications when she&#8217;s run out of options in her COVERT communications tool set. This is the point the anxiety becomes unbearable and the
  need for security forces her to be OVERT. This is usually the stage at which she&#8217;s ask something like &#8220;where is this going?&#8221; or &#8220;am I your girlfriend?&#8221; or she may even
  give you an ultimatum. See this for what it is, she feels powerless and this is a press to commit. This is the point at which you will end up as a &#8220;cheater&#8221; or you&#8217;ll continue to
  spin plates. You actually have a lot of options in this situation, in fact more than you will ever have with any individual woman. You can of course take the coward&#8217;s path and just agree to
  exclusivity with her, but in doing so you lose all options (for as far as you&#8217;re willing to commit) as she intently becomes your only means of intimacy. She becomes the broker for your
  sexuality and you lose power, whereas before YOU were in control of your sexual availability.</p>
<p>You could continue to spin her as well, but bear in mind she&#8217;s resorted to OVERTLY confronting you about it and it wont be the last you hear of it. Depending on how long you&#8217;ve had
  her around, you may simply just let her drop. You might also keep her going, but let her cool a bit and come back to her in a few week&#8217;s time. Again, this seems counterintuitive, but your
  attention will either wildly increase in her value of it or she&#8217;ll simply bug out in which case it wasn&#8217;t worth pursuing and you aren&#8217;t wasting your time and effort on a woman with
  less than 100% IL.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Confidence is derived from options.</strong>
</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think of plate theory as a filter so much as it is a means to reinforce confidence. If you were to step into the ring with a professional UFC fighter right now it&#8217;d probably
  be suicide for you. But train for a few years, spar with other fighters and win a few bouts and you&#8217;ll probably be confident enough in your past performances that you know you can hold your
  own in the ring. That&#8217;s the idea, confidence derived from the options of non-exclusive women in hand and from having successfully generated those options in the past.</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s not a numbers game, it&#8217;s a non-exclusivity game. The goal isn&#8217;t racking up as many women as humanly possible in order to sift through the throng and find that one little
  golden flower. In fact that&#8217;s the key to disaster. There is no <a title="AFC Social Conventions" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/afc-social-conventions/">Quality Woman</a>,
  that&#8217;s an idealization. Some are better than others of course, but you don&#8217;t find the perfect woman, you make the perfect woman. There is no needle in the haystack &#8211; that is
  Scarcity / ONEitis thinking &#8211; the point is to mold yourself and any woman who you do exclusively end up with into your own frame. This is a process that should come before you commit to
  exclusivity, not after. The world is filled with guys forever trying to catch up, control the frame and be the Man they should&#8217;ve been long before they entered an LTR. They spend the better
  part of their LTRs/Marriages trying to prove that they deserve their GF&#8217;s / Wife&#8217;s respect when they&#8217;d have done better in letting her come to that conclusion well before the
  commitment through a healthy dose of competition anxiety.

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Rollo, my name is Akash and I am big fan of your posts. They are always lucid, logical, and insightful.</p>
  <p>I discovered the community about 5 months ago after yet another failed relationship characterized by highly AFC behavior on my part. I ended it with a tremendous amount of guilt as I felt
    that because she was a &#8220;good person&#8221; I ought to have made it work even though I wasn&#8217;t in love with her. I am 27 years old.</p>
  <p>
    Based on your posts I would really appreciate your advice on two issues:<br /> (1) how to make the best use of my impending return to school in May for a second undergraduate degree and;<br />
    (2) how to overcome the cognitive dissonance I feel about pursuing women outside the confines of a committed relationship as I still suffer from social conditioning that tells me I will hurt women
    by pursuing primarily sexual relationships with them and so it is immoral to do so.
  </p>
  <p>If you would like to post a reply on the forum, rather than by a PM, for the benefit of others that is fine with me. I wanted to direct these queries to you though as I believe I could
    benefit from your worldy wise opinion.</p>
  <p>Sincerely look forward to hearing from you.</p>
  <p>
    Best,<br /> Akash
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Akash,</p>
<p>I’ll give you a run down of what I can gather from your initial post, but understand that what you’ve given me here is pretty limited as far as information is concerned. I can only assume
  certain things from the very brief description of your life so take what I write with that in mind. In the future give me a better account of what your AFC behaviors were, how your relationships
  have ended, family background, where you live, why you’re pursuing a second degree, etc. I can be more accurate and avoid assumptions this way.</p>
<p>To begin with, you’ve only been involved in the “community” for the past 5 months so the first thing I’m going to tell you is that it takes time to mold your personality and unlearn mental
  schemas you’ve become conditioned to consider integral parts of your current personality. One of the biggest obstacles most men have with accepting the fundaments of a positive masculine mindset is
  the attitude that personality is static and uncontrollable by them. A lot of this “that’s just how I am” mentality comes from this basic conditioning and needs to be addressed from the outset since
  this almost universally is an ego-investment on the part of a guy who’s probably emotionally distressed, confused and/or frustrated.</p>
<p>Understand now that personality is ultimately what YOU determine it to be. This isn’t to say that external factors don’t influence personality; indeed these variables and outside influences are
  exactly the reason men such as yourself do seek out the community. However, it is you who determine what is comfortable for you and what will constitute the traits that makes your personality your
  own. You are most definitely not a blank slate, but you have the capacity to erase parts you don’t like or are unusable and rewrite new parts that you like and prove efficient.</p>
<p>
  <strong>(1) how to make the best use of my impending return to school in May for a second undergraduate degree</strong>
</p>
<p>
  This all depends on what your own personal goals are. The best use you can make of this time is to devote yourself completely to achieving the purpose for which you decided to pursue a second degree
  in the first place. I can only assume you are working for this degree with a set outcome in mind, but is this what you truly want? I ask this because I know far too many men who’ve altered the
  course of their lives to better accommodate the women in their lives or to facilitate their insecurities and fear of rejection. It’s not an unfamiliar story to me to hear of how a guy opted for a
  certain university or a career path because he’d convinced himself that it would sustain a relationship that he was fearful of loosing or he felt was his “responsibility as a man” to be supportive
  of <em>her</em> ambitions at the sacrifice of his own. The conclusion of this scenario, more often than not, ends with a bitter man, mad at himself with the long term results of his choices after
  the woman he’d strived so long to accommodate leaves him for another man who held fast to his own identity and ambition – which is exactly what makes him attractive.
</p>
<p>I’m not sure how or if this fits into your conditions, but let it serve as an illustration for reclaiming and remolding your own personality. Only you have the hindsight to assess why you made
  certain decisions in your life. I’m only asking you to be as brutally critical of your true motivations for making them. Maybe it’s time you review why you decided to pursue a second degree?</p>
<p>
  <strong>(2) how to overcome the cognitive dissonance I feel about pursuing women outside the confines of a committed relationship as I still suffer from social conditioning that tells me I
    will hurt women by pursuing primarily sexual relationships with them and so it is immoral to do so.</strong>
</p>
<p>Akash, any reasonably attractive woman knows you’d like to have sex with her. It’s a primal, chemical instinct and to be bluntly honest, there’s nothing wrong with it. In certain Muslim sects
  men are allowed to take “temporary” wives for a set period of time in addition to their “permanent” wives so long as they support them financially. Some Mormons practice open polygamy in a similar
  fashion. Some men marry and divorce multiple times (and support them congruously). All of these practices are considered, to a greater or lesser degree, moral. The dissonance occurs when the
  rationalizations for a behavior conflict with the motivations for it and the associative psycho-social stigmas that get attached to it. Sorry for the $10 words here, but your feelings of guilt or
  hesitancy in a desire to explore multiple relationships is a calculated result of a very effective social conditioning with a latent purpose meant to curb a natural impulse.</p>
<p>Recognizing this is the first step to progressing beyond it and actually using it (responsibly) to your own advantage. As men, our biological impetus is to have unlimited access to unlimited
  sexuality with females bearing the best physical attributes. This is a rudimentary fact and on some level of consciousness both men and women understand this. No amount of proselytizing or social
  conditioning will erase what God and evolution hard-coded into our collective bio-psychological desires and behaviors. Admittedly, social conventions have historically made a good run at limiting
  this drive, but it can never (nor should it ever) purge this, because in essence it is a survival-ensuring attribute for us.</p>
<p>I wont argue against the utility in the latent purpose of absolute monogamy. No other method proves more valuable in parental investment and developing a strong masculine and feminine psyche in
  a person than that of a committed, opposite sex, two-parent family. I feel it’s necessary to add here that I am thoroughly unconvinced that gender identity is exclusively a set of learned behaviors
  as many in the mainstream would try to convince us of. There is simply too much biological evidence and the resulting psychological/behavioral response to gender differences to accept this, making
  it vitally important that a child (and later a healthy adult) be taught a healthy appreciation for both the masculine and feminine influences in their psyches.</p>
<p>The genders were meant to be complimentary, not adversarial. I certainly would never condone infidelity based on just this principle alone since it seems the most beneficial for healthy adults.
  It’s when this healthy monogamy becomes clouded by infantile, emotionality and insecure romanticisms with the resulting expectations that are derived by them that it becomes necessary for a man to
  cultivate an attitude of being the PRIZE. Adopting this mindset broadens his selection of opportunities for monogamy to his greatest advantage prior to committing to monogamy. In other words, if you
  are essentially sacrificing your capacity to pursue your biological imperative (unlimited access to unlimited sexuality), pragmatically, you’ll want to choose a partner of the highest quality from
  the broadest pool of potential you are capable of attracting.</p>
<p>The downside of this proposition is twofold. First, your ability to attract a sizable pool of quality ‘applicants’ is limited by factors you immediately have available. At 37, if all goes well,
  you’ll be more financially stable and mature than you are at 27. The 37 year old Akash will, in theory, be more attractive to a long term prospect than the 27 year old Akash. Secondly, women’s
  sexual value decreases as they age, meaning there is no guarantee that your beautiful, vivacious, 27 year old bride will remain so at 37. In fact the odds are she wont.</p>
<p>All of this makes betting your biological imperative on monogamy critically important and thus deserving of the widest possible selection.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Men literally live and die according to their options, so it stands to reason they ought to entertain a prolonged period in their lives where they are open to exploring the most
    options they have access to while concurrently developing and improving themselves prior to making a commitment of this magnitude.</strong>
</p>
<p>And this is precisely where most men fail. They buy into and internalize psychological social contrivances (i.e. ONEitis) that are little more than effective means of inculcating a
  self-expectation of accountability and liability to make this commitment, irrespective of maturity level or personal success (not simply financial success). The saddest ones, the AFC ones are the
  pitiable men who carry these contrivances into marriage and even old age without ever understanding that they had more potential which they squandered due to an inability to see past these
  contrivances and learn to be selective based on experience.</p>
<p>A truly powerful Man jealously guards his most precious resources; his independence and his ability to maneuver. In other words his options and his ability to exercise them. True power
  isn&#8217;t controlling others, but the degree to which you control the course of your own life and your own choices. Commitment to anything ALWAYS limits this. When you step through one door, a
  hundred more close behind you. You&#8217;re free to do what you want, right? You can always quit a job, divorce a wife, change your school, etc., but how many men do you know who are what they are
  today as a result of their own real doing, unfettered by how their choices impact their GF, wife, kids, parents, etc.? By comparison, how many guys do you know who dutifully stick with a dead-end
  job that&#8217;s slowly killing them because it&#8217;s better than dealing with the consequences and backlash it would have on his family? Are they free to quit? Sure, but not without an impact on
  their families and relationships.</p>
<p>So where does this leave you? You have 2 paths as I see it. You can sarge and explore your options with multiple LTRs and, should you decide to become sexually involved, do so while maintaining
  non-exclusivity with them. Put off and unlearn the expectations you’ve been conditioned to accept through (feminine beneficent) social contrivances and truly explore your opportunities while
  bettering your own conditions in anticipation for becoming monogamous at some later point. Or, you can remain in your sense of moral doctrine (no shame in this) and still non-exclusively date and
  explore your options while you continue to better yourself with the caveat that you know you’ll be limiting your depth of experience. I wont denigrate a decision to opt for this, but far too few
  religious men have the perseverance to stay objective in their decision to ‘hold out’ and overlook major character flaws in women they’d like to be their spouse in a furious rush to marry them and
  get to “the sex part.” Better to fall short in conviction than make hurried decisions that will alter your life.</p>
<p>And perhaps this isn’t even what you’re driving at? I don’t know if it’s a religious conviction or an internalized social contrivance that passes for one that’s the cause of your hesitancy, but
  isn’t it interesting that both are so closely associated? I know devout atheists who still believe in the fallacy of the ONE or the soulmate myth. Most women (and far too many men) look at me as if
  I’d denied the existence of God when I elaborate on why I think their eHarmony, induced fantasy of a soulmate is hogwash and psychologically damaging on a social scale.</p>
<p>Regardless, whatever your reasons, women should only ever be a compliment to a man’s life, never the focus of it. When you start living for a woman you become that woman. Never again compromise
  your own identity to receive the ever-changing approval she grants you. You have to be the PRIZE at all times, not just while you’re single. In fact, it’s imperative that you remain so into an LTR.
  My suggestion to you is not to even entertain the idea of monogamy until you are established in your career for 2 years, after your college is complete. Play the field, do whatever, but do not
  commit even to a girlfriend. Rather make a commitment to yourself, promise yourself you wont allow yourself to let emotionality and conditioned expectations of monogamy dictate what your goals will
  be or how you’ll achieve them.</p>
<p>It’s called enlightened self-interest; you cannot help anyone until you’ve first helped yourself.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Plate Theory IV: Goal-State&nbsp;Monogamy</h1>


<p>
  Whenever a guy uninitiated to the concept of <a title="Plate Theory" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/plate-theory-2/">spinning plates</a> reads the theory for the first time his
  first response is usually rejection of it because it conflicts with their monogamy-as-goal mindset. Understand, this is always going to be a tough stretch for any AFC of course, but also the
  &#8216;natural&#8217; guy who doesn&#8217;t have much trouble attracting women. Monogamy-as-a-goal is a feminine imperative social contrivance, but it also has roots in our natural desire for
  security, so it makes anything even remotely like plate spinning counterintuitive. The feminine imperative pounds into men&#8217;s collective consciousnesses over the course of a lifetime that
  monogamy will <a title="The Myth of the Lonely Old Man" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/12/the-myth-of-the-lonely-old-man/">cure loneliness</a>, make them responsible, provide them
  with a constant supply of sex, and a host of other things that assures them it&#8217;s &#8220;the right thing to do&#8221; and in their own best interest. This then leads the more option-less
  individuals to develop and practice AFC methods and rationales in accordance with what they believe (and have been told by) women is required of them in order to achieve their monogamous intimacy.
</p>
<p>So understandably when the principle of being non-exclusive is presented to them in a rational way (in stead of a ridiculed way as it&#8217;s normally passed off as) it conflicts with this
  perceived path to happiness in monogamy. The very idea that any man would be better off with more options in this arena of life, or could feasibly and logistically pull it off seems foreign. As a
  counter to this he makes up rationales as to why it wont work or wont work for him.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Logistics</strong><br /> <em></em>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>&#8220;I can&#8217;t spin plates because I have too little time, I can&#8217;t manage more than one without the other finding out, etc.&#8221;</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are indeed spinning plates in a healthy, upfront, non-exclusive way this should never be an issue. There are Game-aware Men with less time than most who manage 4-5 different girls in a
  week without having them consume all their leisure and business time. I don&#8217;t suggest that you go this route per se, because for the better part PUAs rely on a dishonesty in non-exclusivity.
  However, the reason they are capable of this is because they&#8217;ve perfected plate spinning effectively enough to have the plates spin themselves.</p>
<p>Most uninitiated AFCs reason that they MUST, at all costs, apply a constant effort to each and every girl they encounter at risk of losing a &#8220;good one.&#8221; Besides this being
  indicative of &#8216;soul-mate thinking&#8217;, what they fear is losing a plate because they are unaccustomed to having the leisure to do so. This is evidence of a scarcity mentality that is a
  result of their monogamy-as-goal preconditioning. Plate Theory necessitates an attitude of fearlessness &#8211; not carelessness, fearlessness. When you&#8217;re practicing Plate Theory your plates
  should call you. You are the PRIZE and the Prince who&#8217;s time is valuable and sought after. You should be the object of women&#8217;s pursuit. That said, you still have to make an effort to see
  them and keep the attention you do apply to them valuable, but this must be done with the attitude that if one plate falls you&#8217;re confident in your other options or your ability to generate
  new options.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Personality Type</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m just not like that. I don&#8217;t want to be considered a playah. I could never do that to a woman. How can anyone be like that?&#8221;</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  <em></em>This rationale is a common one and not limited just to AFCs. There are plenty of otherwise confident, positively masculine men who&#8217;d still think they owe it to women to allow them to
  set the frame of their relationships without any fear of competition anxiety. Players are men who&#8217;re dishonest &#8211; they are not spinning plates because they are isolating each plate
  independent of the other, and this goes back to logistics. Of course you can&#8217;t find time for anything else if all you do is try to coordinate each individual story with each plate for fear
  that they discover each other. The plate spinning Man has no need for this, because he <a title="Plate Theory II: Non-Exclusivity"
    href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/plate-theory-ii-non-exclusivity/"
  ><strong>NEVER IMPLIES EXCLUSIVITY TO ANY PLATE</strong>.</a> Either they accept this or they&#8217;re not a plate to consider. Done in a frank, honest, yet indirect above-table way you will not be a
  &#8216;Player&#8217; and you will establish yourself as Man who&#8217;s attention is worth competing for.
</p>
<p>
  Women would rather share a successful man than be saddled with a faithful loser. This perfectly sums up Plate Theory vs. Monogamy-as-Goal mindsets. Men in general gravely underestimate the power of
  female competition anxiety and how useful it really is. As I&#8217;ve said before, women are natural plate theorists – they are accustomed from a very early age to mitigate multiple sex-interests,
  they simply learn how to balance their indirect communications with that anxiety in their own plate spinning. Anxiety in women is good for men. Even when they make no effort to use it or would never
  consider it if they knew it&#8217;s usefulness it is ALWAYS present. Everything a woman does on a daily basis is colored by competition anxiety. Make up, clothing, shoes (God, the SHOES!), indirect
  communications with men and women, social contrivances, comparing and evaluating dates and possible suitors, EVERYTHING is bourn from this competitive desire to achieve security with the best
  possible guy and make damn sure the girl next door doesn&#8217;t get him first. This anxiety is analogous to men&#8217;s consummate fear of rejection and all of the myriad rationales he&#8217;ll
  create and the <a title="Buffers" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/buffers/">Buffers</a> he&#8217;ll devise to avoid it.
</p>
<p>Bear in mind that monogamy is a dictate of the feminine imperative. It is the social contract that the feminine ultimately needs in order to quell a constant desire for security in a very
  chaotic world. When you are predisposed to monogamy-as-goal thinking, or trying to break yourself of this, understand that this is a tool of the feminine imperative. That&#8217;s not to discount the
  overall merits of monogamy, but it is to make you aware of how it&#8217;s acculturated into men as a responsibility to providing monogamy. Men who find themselves in a state of internal conflict
  about abandoning monogamy-as-goal are really confronting a fundamental shift in their prior conditioning.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Plate Theory V: Lady&#8217;s&nbsp;Game</h1>


<p>I had a good amount of response on last Friday&#8217;s Plate Theory post asking for a more complete idea of women being natural Plate Theorists, so I thought I&#8217;d elaborate on this.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Female Plate Theory</strong>
</p>
<p>For as often as I&#8217;ve mentioned women being natural plate theorists, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever gone into detail about it. I think it&#8217;s pretty well established that I
  completely disagree with idea that women will only fuck one guy at a time. I could outline several women I know from experience in this, but really, observing behavior will bear this out fairly
  predictably. I will however agree that they are predisposed to, and are socially encouraged to, seek monogamy, but as in all things female the talk rarely matches the behavior. Sexuality is a
  woman&#8217;s first, best agency and even the homeliest woman know this – even when they&#8217;re just complaining about other women using it.</p>
<p>The principle that a woman&#8217;s first priority is to seek out security is true, and we&#8217;d be wise to bear this in mind when evaluating motives for behavior, but their methodology is
  what&#8217;s in question here. There is an understandable confusion for guys in this respect. On one hand women present a constant facade that the fear of being perceived as a slut (i.e.
  concurrently fucking more than one guy at a time) is primary to their self-respect and respectability. However, this has to be tempered with the desire to experience a variety of men in order to
  ensure the security/provisioning from the best among them. So in order to facilitate this women must practice a kind of calculated hypocrisy that is socially reinforced by the gender as a whole as
  well as some men (usually those so optionless as to excuse the behavior in order to get to her sexuality, or guys so conditioned that they overlook it as normal).</p>
<p>
  <strong>It is socially acceptable for a woman to blatantly spin plates.</strong>
</p>
<p>Does this sound outrageous? While a woman who makes her sexual practices a bit too overt runs the risk of being perceived as a slut (which is dubious in this age as it is), most relatively
  attractive women covertly have a constant bullpen of starters ready to go to bat at any one time – these are also known as &#8216;Orbiters&#8217;. These are the attention providers, the
  &#8220;maybe&#8221; guys. And it makes little difference in terms of available options which she chooses at any given time, the very fact that she has five or six of them pursuing her is enough to
  boost her sense of self-worth, her social status within her same-gender peers, and give her the confidence to drop any one of her plates at a moments notice for any reason knowing that 2 or 3 more
  guys (or 20 more on facebook) stand ready to take his place, no questions asked and prepared rationalizations at the ready.</p>
<p>
  In addition, this practice is socially reinforced by women doing the same thing and the social conventions constructed to excuse the behavior. It&#8217;s the unspoken rule of a woman&#8217;s
  prerogative; <strong><em>she can always change her mind</em></strong>. This is a powerful tool for women – in any situation, if a woman doesn&#8217;t choose to be sexual it is necessarily forced (or
  obligated), even when it&#8217;s after the fact. Either the &#8220;Jerk&#8221; forced her, physically or emotionally, or she had thought she wanted to, but later reconsidered &#8211; it makes little
  difference. In all social situations the default is to side with the feminine, the &#8220;weaker sex&#8221; &#8211; women, from sympathy or empathy, and men, from a desire to eventually become
  intimate with them. Dalrock expertly describes this convention in his &#8220;<a href="http://dalrock.wordpress.com/2011/12/26/dont-hit-me-im-a-girl/">Don&#8217;t hit me, I&#8217;m a girl</a>&#8221;
  post.
</p>
<p>In either instance, the feminine prerogative is socially reinforced. That&#8217;s important to understand because even by my focusing on it here as a male, my motives for doing so become
  suspect. That&#8217;s how embedded this dynamic is &#8211; to question it risks ostracization. However, I also understand that for the greater part of women, this plate spinning dynamic isn&#8217;t
  a conscious effort on their part. In fact I&#8217;d suggest that it&#8217;s so thoroughly recognized that women default to it autonomously. Also, this is a good example of the first principle of
  power – when you have power, always feign powerlessness.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Free Reign</strong>
</p>
<p>
  So, with a firm understanding that their behaviors will for the most part be excused, they are free to practice the feminine form of plate theory unhindered by social reprisal. The feminine plate
  spinning involves much more than sex though. Remember that <a title="Your Attention Please." href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/your-attention-please/">attention is the coin of
    the realm in female society</a>. The capacity to command attention determines self-esteem, peer status, sexual selectivity, and a host of other factors in a woman&#8217;s life, so spinning plates
  becomes more than just a &#8220;which guy am I gonna bang tonight&#8221; prospect. This dynamic and these factors are what makes women natural plate spinners. Even when a woman has no intention of
  ever becoming sexual with a &#8220;maybe&#8221; guy, his attention still has some value to her. It appeals to the long term prospective for security that&#8217;s a continuous subroutine running in
  her hindbrain. This is the rudimentary psychology behind hypergamy.
</p>
<p>Now, combine all of this with women&#8217;s native language &#8211; covert communication &#8211; and it&#8217;s natural for a man to assume that a woman will only ever become sexual with one
  guy at a time. This serves the latent purpose of keeping him in a kind of stasis. If he assumes women will only be sexual under the precondition of commitment she is free to spin plates (essentially
  weighing options) as she pleases and sample at will what she sees as in her hypergamic best interest at the time. If the carrot looks good enough the guy will patiently pull the cart until such time
  as another, better carrot comes along. Either way he&#8217;s in that stasis. If a guy were to see her social and psychological machinations for what they are, he&#8217;d never pull the cart – so it
  serves women best that men think commitment should always be required for intimacy, even in the face of her behavior directly contradicting this.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Plate Wars</strong>
</p>
<p>Lastly, this social dynamic serves as a very effective weapon for women against each other. As I stated in the last Plate Theory post, competition anxiety between women is something men can
  exploit for their own plate spinning, but the reason it is useful is because women so readily use it against each other. For a woman to say another is a &#8220;slut&#8221; translates into an overt
  betrayal of this unspoken social contrivance. She essentially is saying, &#8220;the rules are that women require commitment for sex, but here&#8217;s one who&#8217;ll never be worthy of any
  guy&#8217;s commitment because she wont play by the rules you suckers think she will.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is tacitly disqualified for a man&#8217;s commitment and is, at least in the accusing woman&#8217;s mind, a reduced threat in this feminine competition. She becomes exposed in the same game
  they&#8217;re all playing and in being so loses attention and therefore status and personal esteem. It seems petty to guys, but it&#8217;s really intra-gender warfare. Think of how many times an
  exceptionally attractive woman, that is completely anonymous to a group of women you happen to be with, berate her based on appearance alone. &#8220;She&#8217;s must be a tramp if she dressed like
  that.&#8221; These are the same women who&#8217;ll berate a man for basing his estimation of a woman on her outer appearance. This is feminine competition anxiety. Ask a woman to name the most
  attractive female actress they can think of. Odds are it will be a woman (who as a guy you&#8217;d never think of) who presents the least threat of this anxiety.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, as I&#8217;m fond of saying, women will fuck. They may not fuck you, they may not fuck me, but they will fuck someone. The girl who bangs the hot guy at the foam party in Cancun on
  Spring Break within 5 minutes of meeting him is the same girl who want&#8217;s you to believe that they&#8217;ll only fuck one guy at a time and then after commitment. All women are sexual, you just
  need to be the right guy at the right time for the job.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Plate Theory VI: Abundance &amp;&nbsp;Scarcity</h1>


<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor</strong><br /> Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are
    already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  <a title="Plate Theory" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/plate-theory-2/" target="_blank">Plate Theory</a> is for your benefit, not for women&#8217;s. That might sound harsh, but
  it&#8217;s a method intended to increase your value as a commodity that works on two levels. First, the external &#8211; by practicing honest, non-exclusive dating you communicate to your
  prospective plates that you are in demand. I&#8217;ve gone so far as to tell men to foster this sense by never answering the phone from Friday to Sunday evening, even when they have no other plans.
  The perception that your attention is sought after increases it&#8217;s value &#8211; it&#8217;s when men are too eager to get with a woman that their attention becomes worthless and IL declines.
  Nothing serves a man better than having 3 or 4 women competing for his exclusive attention and fostering in them that feminine competitivie anxiety in as subtle and covert a way as possible.
  It&#8217;s a real art that women are all too familiar with. Women are natural plate theorists, they simply use their varying degrees of physical attractiveness to line their plates up.
</p>
<p>Secondly, plate theory is for a man&#8217;s own internal benefit. As I said in my original thread, it&#8217;s much easier for a man not to give a shit if he truly doesn&#8217;t give a shit.
  It&#8217;s far easier to deal with women on the basis of indifference when you have a subconscious knowledge that there are at least 3 other women who&#8217;ll be happy to have your attention if one
  plays games with you.</p>
<p>You will invariably pass most shit tests in this fashion. The reason men fail most shit tests is because they subconsciously telegraph too much interest in a single woman. Essentially a shit
  test is used by women to determine one, or a combination of these factors:</p>
<p>
  a.) Confidence &#8211; first and foremost<br /> b.) Options &#8211; is this guy really into me because I&#8217;m &#8216;special&#8217; or am I his only option?<br /> c.) Security &#8211; is this
  guy capable of providing me with long term security?
</p>
<p>By practicing Plate Theory, your mental attitude will be such (or should be such) that you will pass most shit test based simply on this practice. Abundance thinking is the root of Plate
  Theory. A lot has been written about approaching women (and really life in general) from a position of Abundance. People often make the mistake of assuming that having a wide variety of choices
  tends to cheapen the commodity, and to a degree this is accurate, but it also allows for a better, learned awareness of which choice amongst the pool is common and which is of higher quality.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>,&#8230;but Rollo, I&#8217;m so busy that I have no choice but to ignore and postpone. They sense it and seek me out. I worry that I&#8217;ll create crazies. My weekends are jammed. At what
    point do we stop?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a the best problem you can have. You&#8217;ve successfully flipped the script; you&#8217;ve gotten to a point where it becomes instinctive and your plates actively seek out your
  attention. By default, you&#8217;re creating value by scarcity. At what point do you stop? How old are you? If you&#8217;re under 30 stay in the game. If you&#8217;re over 30, stay in the game, but
  cool things off occasionally – the only time a man should even contemplate monogamy is after experiencing abundance. If you&#8217;re innundated with women occupying your weekends, consider hooking
  up with a proven plate on a Thursday evening and reserve your weekends for your other pursuits.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t be afraid to clear your schedule to hang out with friends or do other things that interest you. Remember, scarcity increases value. Too many guys think that plate spinning is
  something that needs a constant effort, it doesn&#8217;t. In fact applying yourself equally across all your active plates only pushes you closer to settling for one or two. Most guys think that they
  have to continually spin their plates, you don&#8217;t; if you&#8217;re doing it correctly they&#8217;ll spin themselves for you. The anxiety is that if you don&#8217;t keep applying attention to
  any one plate she&#8217;ll lose interest and fall off. Sometimes this is the case and you have to be prepared to accept it, some plates have to break in order to spin more, and that&#8217;s OK. More
  often than not however, your scarcity will create value and mystique, thus they will pursue you for their affirmation.</p>
<p>
  Plate theory of course can be a means to an LTR, but bear in mind that it&#8217;s essential that you practice it long enough and effectively enough to determine what a quality woman means to you and
  how to recognize her. As with most Game skills, the AFC will use them to some degree of success up to the point that he finds his idealized &#8220;<a title="Dream Girls and Children with Dynamite"
    href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/22/dream-girls-and-children-with-dynamite/"
  >girl of his dreams</a>&#8221; and launch into a self-destructive LTR because his idealization was based on juvenile impressions rather than a mature understanding of what a quality woman&#8217;s
  characteristics are. This is all due to a lack of concrete experience.
</p>
<p>Spin plates for as long as possible, because once you do commit to an LTR, even with the tightest of Game you will lose a measure of the competitive anxiety that made your attentions valuable
  to any one woman. All your plates fall off AND the girl you&#8217;re engaged in an LTR with relaxes. This is root of why men find that the woman they had hot sweaty monkey sex with when they were
  dating becomes more sexually reserved a few months after they&#8217;re a couple. The competitive anxiety is relieved and therefore sexual frequency and quality is no longer a proving trait for her.
  That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t methods to stoke this anxiety in an LTR, but, by comparisson to being single, the frame of the relationship doesn&#8217;t have to be contested when she and
  you understand that she is your only source of intimacy and sex. In a committed relationship, you simply cannot spin plates.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Enter White Knight</h1>


<p>The following was a timely question by SoSuave member &#8220;OnTheWayUp&#8221;;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just wanted to find out: who do you talk to about aspects of game with off this site? I&#8217;m talking here about &#8220;game&#8221; in the broadest sense of the term, so pick-up, but also
    self-esteem, how to keep a relationship healthy, the roles of men and women in society etc.</p>
  <p>My experience with voicing the views advocated on here in public has nearly always been negative. I have 3 &#8211; 4 good male friends who are interested in pick-up (one has read the Mystery
    Method, for example), and they love it. But these friends are the exception rather than the rule. My parents (beta dad, controlling mum) think my attitude towards women is sexist and my opinion of
    ONSs &#8220;disgusting.&#8221; Just about everybody I know subscribes to the Disney/ soulmate view of relationships, and some of my contemporaries (I&#8217;m 21) are even starting to settle down
    and get married. God help them. Talking to girls in bed about what they find attractive in a man is interesting, if only to see the extent to which they delude themselves, but ultimately
    counter-productive, since a woman (tacitly) expects a man to know how to express his sexuality.</p>
  <p>Can we as men ever talk about these things in public? What are your experiences?</p>

  publicly redressing a &#8220;villain&#8221; like you for your chauvinism. Even under the conditions of relative anonymity (like the internet), he&#8217;ll still cling to that want of proving his
  uniqueness just on the off chance that a woman might read his rebuff and be fatefully attracted to him.</p>
<p>
  This is the bread and butter of the White Knight beta. It&#8217;s best to assume that most guys who pick up on just your Game vibe, to say nothing of overtly talking about it, are going to side with
  the feminine imperative by default. For practitioners of <a title="Beta Game" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/beta-game/">Beta Game</a> (which is to say the better part of 90% of
  guys) this is an organic opportunity to identify with women and engage in the same shaming conventions women use without the fear of having it seem contrived.
</p>
<p>Now this is the mechanics of it, but the rabbit hole goes deeper than that. For the Beta Game that our noble white knight is so invested in to work, he depends on an assumed system. He depends
  upon reaffirming his assumed understanding of how to best achieve a woman&#8217;s intimacy (sex). He must reaffirm that presumption BY defending it and looking for opportunities to show he adheres
  to the feminine imperative (or the version of the imperative he&#8217;s been taught to believe). His Game, his ego-invested identity IS literally dependent upon that system. So not only is he
  defending his Game and his ego, be he&#8217;s also defending the social architecture that makes his Beta Game even possible.</p>
<p>
  You see, when an AFC clings to the mental schemas that make up an <a title="AFC Social Conventions" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/14/afc-social-conventions/">AFC mindset </a>it
  requires a constant need for affirmation and reinforcement, particularly in light of a glaring lack of verifiable success with women while clinging to, and behaving in accordance with the mindset.
  AFCs are like crabs in a barrel &#8211; once one gets to the top to climb out another drags him back in. The AFC needs other AFCs to affirm his blatantly obvious lack of success. He needs other AFCs
  to tell him, &#8220;don&#8217;t worry just be yourself&#8221; or &#8220;she&#8217;s just not a quality woman because she can&#8217;t see how great a guy you are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  So when an AFC finally does get a second date and then finally does get laid it becomes the ultimate validation for his mindset. &#8220;See, you just have to be a patient nice guy and the right <a
    title="There is no One." href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/30/there-is-no-one/"
  >ONE</a> really does come along.&#8221; This is when the self-righteous phase begins and he can begin telling his PUA friends that Beta Game does work, and he&#8217;s &#8220;getting some&#8221; now
  without all the Positive Masculinity claptrap. In actuality he rationalizes away all of the conditions that lead up to him getting the girlfriend and the fundamental flaw that he&#8217;s settling
  for a woman &#8220;who&#8217;d fuck him&#8221;, but this doesn&#8217;t stop him from claiming a moral high ground. His long wait is over and he&#8217;s finally hit White Knight pay-dirt.

<h1 class="entry-title">Average Frustrated Chump</h1>


<p>In the &#8220;community&#8221; there&#8217;s a lot of want for better terms. One of the major obstacles in the average guy&#8217;s path to unplugging is really coming to terms with the
  &#8216;terms&#8217; we use. Somewhere on the net I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a glossary of the common acronyms used in the &#8220;manosphere&#8221; (I hate that term too) outlining the various
  shorthand we use. Some of these terms have gone mainstream and I&#8217;m beginning to see even &#8220;legitimate&#8221; online journalists use LTR (long term relationship) or ONS (one night stand)
  somewhat regularly, meaning there&#8217;s a common perception that others will already know what they mean.</p>
<p>The reason this is a hurdle for a lot of plugged-in guys is because it seems almost juvenile, like a treehouse club for preteen boys. For me to draw comparisons of an acculturated, feminine
  social paradigm to the central plot of the Matrix movies, admittedly, on the surface that seems kind of silly. It&#8217;s an apt comparison and a useful allegory when you understand the concepts
  behind it, but for a guy just coming to grasp it while being immersed in a feminine-primary socialization for his whole life, it dosen&#8217;t click. And predictably, women invested in that same
  socialization see the terminology as little more than little boys holed up in their treehouse, throwing rocks at the girls below.</p>
<p>However, like any new developing science or art or technology there is always going to be a need to codify abstract concepts. We lack better terms so we&#8217;re forced to create new ones to
  represent new concepts.</p>
<p>
  The AFC &#8211; average frustrated chump &#8211; was coined almost a decade ago with Mystery method. It&#8217;s seen a lot of modification over the years, becoming almost synonymous the use of the
  term <a title="Beta or Herb?" href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2010/05/19/beta-or-herb/">Beta (beta male) or Herb (herbivorous male).</a> In fact, although I use it often, I rarely read AFC in
  PUA blogs, forums or the &#8216;community&#8217; at large. Regardless of the terminology, the concept is really the crux of the term. Most AFCs, most guys looking in from the outside, can relate to
  the<em> idea</em> of what an average frustrated chump is &#8211; they can identify with it. Once they begin unplugging, the AFC idea comes into better focus and, usually with some discomfort, they
  realize how that term applies to themselves:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Qualities of an AFC</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ONEitis – First and foremost.</li>
  <li>Subscribes to feminine idealizations.</li>
  <li>Supplication is supportive. To comply with gender equalism she must increase, so he must decrease, regardless of how subtly this is realized.</li>
  <li>The Savior Schema –reciprocation of intimacy for problems solved.</li>
  <li>The Martyr Schema – the more you sacrifice the more it shows devotion.</li>
  <li>The ‘Friends’ Debt – LJBF and the pseudo-friendship as a means to prospective intimacy.</li>
  <li>Primarily relies on dating and social skills (or lack thereof) developed during adolescence and early adulthood</li>
  <li>A behavioral history that illustrates a mental attitude of ‘serial monogamy’ and the related insecurities that accompany it.</li>
  <li>A belief that women infallibly and consciously recognize what they want, and honestly convey this to them, irrespective of behaviors that contradict this. Uses deductive reasoning in
    determining intent and bases female motivations on statements rather than objectively observing behavior. Believes women&#8217;s natural propensity is for rational rather than emotional thought.</li>
  <li>An over-reliance on rejection <a title="Buffers" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/buffers/">Buffers.</a></li>
  <li>Believes in the <a title="Identity Crisis" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/identity-crisis-2/">Identification Myth</a>. The more alike he is, or can make himself, with
    his idealized female the better able he will be to attract and secure her intimacy. Believes that shared common interests are the ONLY key to attraction and enduring intimacy.
  </li>
  <li>Believes and practices the “not like other guys” doctrine of self-perceived uniqueness, even under the condition of anonymity.</li>
  <li>Considers LDRs (long distance relationships) a viable option for prolonged intimacy.</li>
  <li>Maintains an internalized belief in the qualifications and characterizations of women that coincide with his ability (or inability) to attract them. Ergo, he self-confirms the “ she’s out
    of my league” and the “she’s a loose slut” mentalities on-the-fly to reinforce his position for his given conditions.</li>
  <li>Harbors irrational (often socially reinforced) <a title="The Myth of the Lonely Old Man" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/12/the-myth-of-the-lonely-old-man/">fears of
      long term solitude</a> and alters his mind-set to accommodate or settle for a less than optimal short term relationship – often with life long consequences.
  </li>
  <li>The AFC will confirm a belief in egalitarian equality between the genders without consideration for variance between the genders. Ergo, men make perfectly acceptable feminine models and
    women make perfectly acceptable masculine models. Due to societal pressures he unconsciously self-confirms androgyny as his goal state.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is anything but a comprehensive list. There are far more, but my intent here isn&#8217;t to provide you with a list of criteria that qualifies an AFC (&#8220;you might be a chump
  if,..&#8221;), rather it&#8217;s to give you some basic understanding to clarify the term, and round out the idea of what an AFC is. Needless to say these mental schema are some of the impediments
  to unplugging, or helping another man unplug, from his old way of thinking. As I&#8217;m fond of repeating, unplugging chumps from the Matrix is dirty work. Expect to be met with a LOT of
  resistance, but understanding what dynamics you may harbor yourself or those that a friend might cling to will help you in moving past the years of social conditioning. It&#8217;s thankless work,
  and more often than not you&#8217;ll also be facing a constant barrage of shit tests (from both women and feminized men) and ridicule in your efforts. Be prepared for it. Unplugging chumps is triage
  &#8211; save those you can, read last rites to the dying.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Playing Friends</h1>


<p>
  <em>Women have boyfriends and girlfriends. If you&#8217;re not fucking her, you&#8217;re her girlfriend.</em>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rollo, how do I get out of the Friend-Zone?&#8221; Never allow yourself to get into it.</p>
<p>Women have used the LJBF (&#8220;let just be friends&#8221;) rejection for a hundred years because it serves an ego preservation function for her. To a greater or lesser degree, women require
  attention and the more they have of it the more affirmation they experience, both personally and socially. The LJBF rejection is a Social Convention that has classically ensured a woman can reject a
  man yet still maintain his previous attention. It also puts the responsibility for the rejection back on his shoulders since, should he decline the &#8216;offer of friendship&#8217;, he is then
  responsible for entertaining this &#8216;friendship&#8217;.</p>
<p>This of course has the potential to backfire on women these days since the standard AFC response will be to accept an LJBF rejection in the mistaken hope of &#8216;proving&#8217; himself worthy
  of her intimacy by being the perfect &#8216;surrogate boyfriend&#8217; &#8211; fulfilling all her attention and loyalty prerequisites with no expectation of reciprocating her own intimacy. I should
  also point out that this situation is analogous to men using women as &#8220;fuck buddies&#8221; &#8211; fulfilling all his sexual availability needs with no expectations of reciprocating
  commitment. Needless to say this merely positions the new &#8220;friend&#8221; into being the &#8217;emotionally supportive&#8217; Beta counterpart to the indifferent Alpha she&#8217;ll consistently
  bang and then complain about &#8211; also popularly known as the Emotional Tampon.</p>
<p>The LJBF rejection also serves as an ego preservation for her in that having offered the false olive branch of &#8216;friendship&#8217; to him in her rejection she can also sleep that night
  knowing that she (and any of her peers) wont think any less of herself. After all, she offered to be friends, right? She is absolved of any feelings of personal guilt or any responsibilities for his
  feelings if she still wants to remain amiable with him.</p>
<p>
  Men get a LJBF rejection because of a process. These are the &#8220;friends first&#8221; mindset guys; the guys who put far too much emphasis on a solitary woman and wait her out until the perfect
  moment to attempt to escalate to intimacy, at which point her most comfortable rejection (<a title="Buffers" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/08/26/buffers/">Buffer</a>) is to LJBF.
  This is made all the more easy for her because of the process the guy used to get to that point.
</p>
<p>
  Virtually all guys who get to the point of a LJBF rejection come to it because they fall in line with some variation of what I call a <em>Sniper Mentality</em>. They patiently wait for their one
  target, to the exception of all others, constantly attempting to prove their quality in doing so &#8211; meaning they emphasize a comfort level and try to be friends before lovers. In essence they
  believe that desexualizing themselves will make them more attractive (by virtue of not being like &#8220;other guys&#8221;) because they&#8217;ve bought into the idea that a woman must be
  comfortable with them first before they initiate intimacy. Once the AFC gets to a point where he&#8217;s mustered enough courage to initiate, and he feels she &#8216;should&#8217; be comfortable
  enough to appreciate him as boyfriend material, the Sniper takes his shot.
</p>
<p>The problem with this process is that it bypasses essential stages of attraction and the necessary discomfort and sexual tension necessary for intimacy and proceeds directly to a warm familiar,
  comfortable, (and ultimately anti-seductive) rapport, the exact opposite of arousal. If you think about this in terms of sex, this is the stage right after climax when she wants to cuddle, spoon and
  be wrapped up in her nice, secure oxytocin induced comfort. This is the opposite of the testosterone fueled, sweaty, anxious and uncomfortable stage of arousal and intercourse before that release.
  So in terms of &#8220;friendship&#8221; and the Sniper mentality, you&#8217;ve skipped arousal and gone straight to comfort. You&#8217;re perceived as a stuffed animal she can hug and then put back
  on the bed. Thus, when that previously platonic stuffed animal uncharacteristically gets a hard-on and says &#8220;I think we ought to be intimate&#8221; her reaction is to think that everything
  you&#8217;ve done for her up to that point has been a grand ruse. &#8220;My God, all you wanted was sex this whole time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her most predictable response is then the LJBF rejection. The field has already been tilled by you, it&#8217;s only one, very easy step for her to stay in that suspended comfort &#8211;
  &#8220;can&#8217;t we just be friends?&#8221; And then the cycle repeats. The AFC believes the LJBF is a genuine offer (not a rejection) and then falls back into the Sniper mentality. He
  mustn&#8217;t have been convincing enough to prove his worth to her and therefore returns to further proving himself as the perfect boyfriend until he once again presses his intent of intimacy after
  another period. All this goes on apace until she becomes intimate with a &#8216;real&#8217; boyfriend and/or he acquires a new target after realizing his efforts with the LJBF girl aren&#8217;t
  bearing fruit.</p>
<p>
  The problem with a lot of the &#8216;friend-zone&#8217; advice women tend to offer is that they cast doubt on whether a LJBF rejection is in fact a rejection and not a genuine offer of friendship.
  To which I&#8217;ll say, the only reason the &#8216;friend-zone&#8217; is such a common issue among men &amp; women for so long is <em>because</em> it&#8217;s been repeated so regularly and the
  outcome so predictable as a rejection. A woman&#8217;s behavior is always the only gauge of her intent, and thus when a rejection like LJBF has been so consistently met with the same outcome and
  behavior (as evidenced by thousands of identical stories from men) it&#8217;s only prudent for a Man to behave in kind.
</p>
<p>
  A man&#8217;s default response should always be to excuse him from the LJBF situation. The reason for this is because it serves his best interest whether she is testing him or is rejecting him. If
  he is confident enough in himself to walk away from the sexually tense environment, he proves himself as decisive enough to put himself above being &#8216;played&#8217; like this. Ergo, he leaves
  her with the impression that he is the PRIZE, possibly has contacts with better prospective women and is confident enough to take away his attentions from her and thus passes any shit test she might
  have implied, while placing the responsibility of a re-connection on her (where it should be anyway). If she has in fact had a change of heart (her prerogative, remember?) and is using the LJBF as a
  means to reject him, he still benefits from all of the above and plants the &#8216;seed of doubt&#8217; in her about her initial estimation of his acceptability for her intimacy. And even if she is
  truly not interested in the guy, <strong>he walks away on his feet and not his knees</strong>, by playing &#8220;friend&#8221; with her and wasting still more time that could be far better spent
  with more productive prospects.
</p>
<p>It is really one of the few win-win Game situations for a guy to make a wholesale withdrawal of his attentions when he is confronted with an LJBF. Women know all too well how an LJBF places
  social pressure on a guy to accept what basically amounts to an ultimatum of negative social proof, and that&#8217;s a hell of a shit test no matter what her real intent is. If the guy turns down
  her offer of friendship, he&#8217;s the dickhead, not her. But the guy that can do what common sense and gut instinct points out to him will be the one to succeed, with her, other women and himself.</p>
<p>
  Human being&#8217;s natural inclination is to avoid confrontation. When a man makes an approach to intimacy with a woman this becomes confrontational. If she is unsure of a man&#8217;s sexual
  acceptability for her intimacy she must resort to psycho-social, learned behaviors to diffuse this confrontation. Preferably these techniques should be reinforced beforehand and proven to diffuse
  just such a confrontation, thus the LJBF response is acted out through generations of women across many different cultures &#8211; quite simply it works more often than not. <strong>You can
    also apply this to the Boyfriend Disclaimer; women who not-so-nonchalantly weave into their casual conversation that they have a boyfriend in a preemptive effort to diffuse a potential
    suitor&#8217;s interests. It&#8217;s basically a proactive LJBF rejection.</strong>
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the guy who is unwilling to accept these conventions that makes the most lasting impressions of confidence with women. It goes against what our common human heritage dictates for us
  &#8211; avoid conflict, don&#8217;t make waves, be her friend, etc. By not accepting a LJBF you emphatically make known that you are good at confrontation, you have an understanding of her motives
  and you&#8217;re confident enough in yourself to make it known. Not only does this impress her with potential for security provision it also implies future confidence. The problem for most guys is
  enacting this and making it a default behavior when our biology would have us move away from conflict rather than engage in an unacceptable social dynamic that is subtly damaging to his own
  interests.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Letting Go of Invisible&nbsp;Friends</h1>


<p>I&#8217;m sorry to break this to you, but there is no such thing as a long distance relationship. That&#8217;s correct, you have no relationship. An LDR simply does not meet the criteria
  necessary for it to be considered a legitimate relationship. There is no reciprocity of anything more than words passing over a phone line or an IM text. Understand me here – you have no
  relationship. You have self-assumed accountability, self-assumed liability and internalized responsibilities to be loyal to this person. You are entertaining a commitment to fidelity with an
  idealization, and ignoring what everyone outside of your LDR will regularly tell you is insanity. LDRs are one of the more insidious forms of ONEitis.</p>
<p>LDRs are the most easily identifiable form of ONEitis, and it would be laughable if it weren&#8217;t so damaging to a guy&#8217;s life progression. The LDR man generally sacrifices years of his
  life in this pitiable effort to pursue his &#8216;soulmate&#8217; across the planet or even a hundred miles away. The very thought of refuting the idea that an LDR can work is equatable to denying
  his belief this fantasized ONEitis fueled idealization that he&#8217;s swallowed for the better part of his life. It’s easy to criticize an LDR in the terms of questioning either party&#8217;s
  earnestness and fidelity in entertaining an LDR and this is usually the tact that most people giving advice on LDRs follow. One or both parties are or will &#8216;cheat&#8217; on the other over the
  course of time, its true, but LDRs are far more telling of a mentality that results in much more damaging consequences as a result of deeply conditioned self-expectations and fears.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t begin to list the number of otherwise intelligent and ambitious men I’ve known who&#8217;ve drastically altered the course of their lives to follow their ONE. Men who&#8217;ve
  changed their majors in college, who&#8217;ve selected or switched universities, men who&#8217;ve applied for jobs in states they would never have considered, accepted jobs that are sub-standard to
  their ambitions or qualifications, men who&#8217;ve renounced former religions and men who&#8217;ve moved across the planet all in an effort to better accommodate an idealized woman with whom
  they&#8217;ve played pseudo-boyfriend with over the course of an LDR; only to find that she wasn&#8217;t the person they thought she was and were depressive over the gravity that their decisions
  played in their lives.</p>
<p>An LDR is akin to a LJBF, but writ large and festering in a man&#8217;s life. You play surrogate boyfriend, voluntarily accepting and internalizing all of the responsibilities and
  accountabilities of being a woman&#8217;s exclusive, monogamous partner with no expectation of reciprocating intimacy or sexuality in the immediate future. However an LDR is worse than a LJBF
  arrangement since it pervasively locks a man into a success or failure mentality with regards to the relationship actually being legitimate. After all, she&#8217;s agreed to remain his girlfriend
  (from miles away) and if he&#8217;s the one to falter it&#8217;s his lack of perseverance in this ONEitis ego-investment that dooms them. Once the LDR inevitably ends he&#8217;s the one left with
  the self-doubt, he&#8217;s the one beating himself up over wasting time, money and effort and he&#8217;s the one feeling guilty whether he or she is the true &#8216;cheater&#8217;.</p>
<p>
  An LDR is like having an invisible friend with whom you&#8217;re constantly considering the course of your actions with. Consider the personal, romantic, familial, educational, career, personal
  maturity and growth opportunities that you&#8217;ve limited yourself from or never had a chance to experience because of this invisible friend. When you finally divorce yourself from this invisible
  friend, will it have all been worth it? Guys cling to LDRs because they&#8217;ve yet to learn that <strong>Rejection is better than Regret</strong>. AFCs will nurse along an LDR for years because it
  seems the better option when compared with actually going out and meeting new women who represent a potential for real rejection. They think its better to stick with the &#8216;sure thing&#8217;,
  but it&#8217;s the long term regret that is the inevitable result of an LDR that is life damaging. Nothing reeks of desperation or verifies a lack of confidence more than a guy who self-righteously
  proclaims he&#8217;s in an LDR. Women see you coming a mile off, because you are a guy without options, clinging to his one previously realized option. In fact the only reason a man entertains an
  LDR is due to a lack of options. If you had more plates spinning an LDR would never look like a good idea.
</p>
<p>
  And finally, it&#8217;s not uncommon to see the <em>&#8220;not in my case&#8221;</em> defense offered about how you actually DO see your invisible friend once every 4 or six months. To this
  I&#8217;ll say again, what opportunities are you censoring yourself from experiencing by playing house with a woman you only see this often? Do you honestly think you&#8217;re the exception to the
  rule? The truth is you&#8217;re molding your lifestyle around what you hope your relationship will be in the future &#8211; that&#8217;s no way to live.

<h1 class="entry-title">The Honor System</h1>

  style='border: 0;'
></iframe>
<em>&#8220;An unfamiliar feeling for one of you, but a horribly familiar feeling for the other.&#8221;</em>
</p>
<p>The concept of Honor that men began has been made to serve a feminine purpose. I have no doubt that the principle of honor dates back from as long ago as we can track human civilization, but
  like so many other social foundation Men have instituted, the feminine will covertly position them to their own purpose.</p>
<p>
  In the introduction to the <em>Art of Seduction</em> author Robert Greene explains why there was an original need for seduction to be developed into an art. For this we can look back to ancient
  civilizations where women were essentially a commodity. They had no OVERT external power to control their fates, but they excelled (and still do) at COVERT psychological internal power, and this of
  course finds a parallel in men and women&#8217;s preferred communication methods. The feminine&#8217;s primary agency has always been sexuality and manipulating influence by its means.
</p>
<p>Much in the same way that each gender communicates, so too is their method of interacting within their own gender. As Men we&#8217;re respected when we keep our word, sacrifice ourselves for a
  worthy cause (even to the point of disposability), solve problems rationally, our word is our bond, and a whole host of other qualifiers that make us respectable and worthy of integrity. We must be
  OVERT and above board; and when we encounter a man who is COVERT in his dealings we call him &#8216;shifty&#8217; and think him untrustworthy. Even for the most noble of purposes, practicing the art
  of misdirection is not something men are respected for &#8211; at least not publicly.</p>
<p>
  It&#8217;s just this overt masculine interactive nature that women are only too ready to exploit. In combination with their sexual agency and influence they use this overt male social interactive
  dynamic to position themselves in places where they can use indirect power. Cleopatra was an excellent example of this &#8211; sending armies to war by appealing to powerful men&#8217;s pride and
  honor, while reserving her sexuality as a reward. Virtually every <a title="Operative Social Conventions" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/09/operative-social-conventions/">Feminine
    Social Convention</a> is rooted in appealing to, or attacking male social institutions &#8211; a dedication to an idealistic sense of honor being chief among them. The obvious example is of course
  &#8220;shaming&#8221; and the &#8220;do-the-right-thing&#8221; social contract.
</p>
<p>In fact to be a &#8220;Man&#8221; has become synonymous with living up to a feminine imperative that&#8217;s cleverly disguised as masculine Honor. It&#8217;s not that women created Honor, but
  rather that they&#8217;ve recreated it to serve their purpose. In the Biblical Ten Commandments we&#8217;re told not to commit adultery &#8211; don&#8217;t sleep with another man&#8217;s wife
  &#8211; which probably wasn&#8217;t too hard to abide by when polygamy was the norm. In fact multiple wives was a sign of affluence, it used to be the conspicuous consumption of the epoch. Why then
  is polygamy a social perversion now? What changes occurred that made polygamy honorable (even enviable) into a very evil taboo?</p>
<p>Along with language and culture, social conditions evolve. What we think of as Honorable today are the result of centuries molding. It&#8217;s very easy to romanticize about times when Honor
  among Men reigned supreme, and then lament the sad state of society today in comparison, but doing so is a fools errand. Honor in and of itself is, and should be, a foundation for Men, but
  it&#8217;s only useful when we understand it in the perspective of how it can be used against us.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Man Up or Shut Up – The Male Catch 22</strong>

<p>One of the primary way&#8217;s Honor is used against men is in the feminized perpetuation of traditionally masculine expectations when it&#8217;s convenient, while simultaneously expecting
  egalitarian gender parity when it&#8217;s convenient.</p>
<p>
  For the past 60 years feminization has built in the perfect Catch 22 social convention for anything masculine; The expectation to assume the responsibilities of being a man (Man Up) while at the
  same time denigrating asserting masculinity as a positive (Shut Up). <strong>What ever aspect of maleness that serves the feminine purpose is a man&#8217;s masculine responsibility, yet any
    aspect that disagrees with feminine primacy is labeled Patriarchy and Misogyny.</strong>
</p>
<p>Essentially, this convention keeps beta males in a perpetual state of chasing their own tails. Over the course of a lifetime they&#8217;re conditioned to believe that they&#8217;re cursed with
  masculinity (Patriarchy) yet are still responsible to &#8216;Man Up&#8217; when it suits a feminine imperative. So it&#8217;s therefore unsurprising to see that half the men in western society
  believe women dominate the world (male powerlessness) while at the same time women complain of a lingering Patriarchy (female powerlessness) or at least sentiments of it. This is the Catch 22 writ
  large. The guy who does in fact Man Up is a chauvinist, misogynist, patriarch, but he still needs to man up when it&#8217;s convenient to meet the needs of a female imperative.</p>
<p>In contemporary society we have a very different understanding of what Honor was, or was intended to be initially. One of the psychological undercurrents I see in most AFCs is a strong,
  self-righteous dedication to a very distorted conviction of Honor. A main tenet being an unearned, default respect for women; essentially an unearned Honor placed on a woman for no other reason than
  she&#8217;s female. We learn this (usually) from the time we&#8217;re children, &#8220;never hit a girl&#8221;. Naturally, this has only been ferociously encouraged by the feminine since Victorian
  times because it served a latent purpose right up until on demand (feminine exclusive) birth control was offered, and then prompted the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>
  Today, we still have women using the anachronism that is male Honor in a manner that serves their interests, but it&#8217;s contrasted with a sexually emphasized opportunism. A Man&#8217;s
  responsibility <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should </span>be &#8220;Honoring&#8221; her as &#8216;the fairer sex&#8217; while recognizing her &#8216;independence&#8217;. The AFC gobbles
  this stuff up and in an effort to better <a title="Identity Crisis" href="https://rationalmale.wordpress.com/2011/09/04/identity-crisis-2/" target="_blank">identify himself</a> with her ideals he
  begins to convince himself that he&#8217;s unique in that he better exemplifies this false-virtue, this feminine defined sense of Honor than &#8220;other guys&#8221;.
