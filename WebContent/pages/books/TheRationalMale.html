  <img scr="img/books/red1.jpeg">
  <p>ONEitis is paralysis. You cease to mature, you cease to move, you cease to be you.</p>
  <p>
    There is no ONE. This is the soulmate myth. There are some good Ones and some bad Ones, but <strong>there is no ONE</strong>. Anyone telling you anything else is selling you something. There are
    LOTS of &#8216;special someones&#8217; out there for you, just ask the divorced/widowed person who&#8217;s remarried after their &#8220;soulmate&#8221; has died or moved on.
  </p>
  <p>This is what trips people up about the soul-mate myth, it is this fantasy that we all at least in some way share an idealization of – that there is ONE perfect mate for each of us, and as
    soon as the planets align and fate takes it&#8217;s course we&#8217;ll know that we&#8217;re &#8216;intended&#8217; for each other. And while this may make for a gratifying romantic comedy plot,
    it&#8217;s hardly a realistic way to plan your life. In fact it&#8217;s usually paralyzing.</p>
  <p>What I find even more fascinating is how common the idea is (mostly for guys) that a nuts &amp; bolts view of life should be trumped by this fantasy in the area of inter-sexual relationships.
    Guys who would otherwise recognize the value of understanding psychology, biology, sociology, evolution, business, engineering, etc. and the interplay we see these take place in our lives on a
    daily basis, are some of the first guys to become violently opposed to the idea that maybe there isn&#8217;t &#8216;someone for everyone&#8217; or that there are a lot more ONEs out there that
    could meet or exceed the criteria we subconsciously set for them to be the ONE. I think it comes off as nihilistic or this dread that maybe their ego investment in this belief is false- it&#8217;s
    like saying God is dead to the deeply religious. It&#8217;s just too terrible to contemplate that there maybe no ONE or there maybe several ONEs to spend their lives with. This western
    romanticized mythology is based on the premise that there is only ONE perfect mate for any single individual and as much as a lifetime can and should be spent in constant search of this
    &#8216;soulmate.&#8217; So strong and so pervasive is this myth in our collective society that it has become akin to a religious statement and in fact has been integrated into many religious
    doctrines as feminization of western culture has spread.</p>
  <p>
    I think there&#8217;s been a mischaracterization of ONEitis. It&#8217;s necessary to differentiate between a healthy relationship based on mutual respect and a lopsided ONEitis based relationship.
    I&#8217;ve had more than a few guys seeking my advice, or challenging my take on ONEitis, essentially ask me for permission to accept ONEitis as legitimate monogamy. In my estimation <strong>ONEitis
      is an unhealthy psychological dependency that is the direct result of the continuous socialization of the soulmate myth in pop culture. </strong>What&#8217;s truly frightening is that ONEitis has become
    associated with being a healthy normative aspect of an LTR or marriage.
  </p>
  <p>I come to the conclusion that ONEitis is based in sociological roots, not only due to it being a statement of personal belief, but by the degree to which this ideology is disseminated and
    mass marketed in popular culture through media, music, literature, movies, etc. Dating services like eHarmony shamelessly marketeer and exploit exactly the insecurities that this dynamic engenders
    in people desperately searching for the ONE &#8220;they were intended for.&#8221; The idea that men possess a natural capacity for protection, provisioning and monogamy has merit from both a
    social and bio-psychological standpoint, but a ONEitis psychosis is not a byproduct of it. Rather, I would set it apart from this healthy protector/provider dynamic since ONEitis essentially
    sabotages what our natural propensities would otherwise filter.</p>
  <p>ONEitis is insecurity run amok while a person is single, and potentially paralyzing when coupled with the object of that ONEitis in an LTR. The same neurotic desperation that drives a person
    to settle for their ONE whether healthy or unhealthy is the same insecurity that paralyzes them from abandoning a damaging relationship &#8211; This is their ONE and how could they ever live
    without them? Or, they&#8217;re my ONE, but all I need is to fix myself or fix them to have my idealized relationship. And this idealization of a relationship is at the root of ONEitis. With such
    a limiting, all-or-nothing binary approach to searching for ONE needle in the haystack, and investing emotional effort over the course of a lifetime, how do we mature into a healthy understanding
    of what that relationship should really entail? The very pollyanna, idealized relationship &#8211; the &#8220;happily ever after&#8221; &#8211; that belief in a ONE promotes as an ultimate end, is
    thwarted and contradicted by the costs of the constant pursuit of the ONE for which they&#8217;ll settle for. After the better part of a lifetime is invested in this ideology, how much more
    difficult will it be to come to the realization that the person they&#8217;re with isn&#8217;t their ONE? To what extents will a person go to in order to protect a lifetime of this ego investment?</p>
  <p>At some point in a ONEitis relationship one participant will establish dominance based on the powerlessness that this ONEitis necessitates. There is no greater agency for a woman than to know
    beyond doubt that she is the only source of a man&#8217;s need for sex and intimacy. ONEitis only cements this into the understanding of both parties. For a man who believes that the emotionally
    and psychologically damaging relationship he has ego-invested himself is with the only person in his lifetime he&#8217;s ever going to be compatible with, there is nothing more paralyzing in his
    maturation. The same of course holds true for women, and this is why we shake our heads when the beautiful HB 9 goes chasing back to her abusive and indifferent Jerk boyfriend, because she
    believes he is her ONE and the only source of security available to her. Hypergamy may be her root imperative for sticking with him, but it&#8217;s the soul-mate myth, the fear of the &#8220;ONE
    that got away&#8221; that makes for the emotional investment.</p>
  <p>The definition of Power is not financial success, status or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives. Subscribing to the soulmate mythology
    necessitates that we recognize powerlessness in this arena of our lives. Better I think it would be to foster a healthy understanding that there is no ONE. There are some good Ones and there are
    some bad Ones, but there is no ONE.</p>

    <h1 class="entry-title">The Cardinal Rule of&nbsp;Relationships</h1>
  </header>
  <!-- .entry-header -->

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      <em>In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a foundation of <em>any</em> relationship, not just intersexual ones, but family, business, etc. relationships as well. It is a dynamic that is always in effect. For my own well being
      and that of my family&#8217;s, I need my employer more than he needs me, ergo I get up for work in the morning and work for him. And while I am also a vital part for the uninterrupted
      continuance of his company and endeavours, he simply needs me less than I need him. Now I could win the lottery tomorrow or he may decide to cut my pay or limit my benefits, or I may complete my
      Masters Degree and decide that I can do better than to keep myself yoked to his cart indefinitely, thereby, through some condition either initiated by myself or not, I am put into a position of
      needing him less than he needs me. At this point he is forced into a position of deciding how much I am worth to his ambitions and either part ways with me or negotiate a furtherance of our
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same plays true for intersexual relationships. Whether you want to base your relationship on &#8216;power&#8217; or not isn&#8217;t the issue; it&#8217;s already in play from your first
      point of attraction. You are acceptable to her for meeting any number of criteria and she meets your own as well. If this weren&#8217;t the case you simply would not initiate a mutual
      relationship. This is the first comparisson we make with another individual &#8211; call it &#8216;sizing up&#8217; if you like &#8211; but we make innate (and often unconscious) comparisons
      about <em>everything</em> and in the case of initial attraction we decide if the the other person is acceptable for our own intimacy. From this point it becomes a cooperative negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>This principle isn&#8217;t so much about &#8216;power&#8217; as it is about control. This might sound like semantics, but it does make a difference. It&#8217;s very easy to slip into binary
      arguments and think that what I mean by the cardinal rule of relationships is that one participant must absolutely rule over the other &#8211; a domineering dominant personality to a doormat
      submissive personality. Control in a healthy relationship passes back and forth as desire and need dictate for each partner. In an unhealthy realationship you have an unbalanced manipulation of
      this control by a partner.</p>
    <p>Although control is never in complete balance, it becomes manipulation when one partner, in essence, blackmails the other with what would otherwise be a behavioral reinforcer for the
      manipulated partner under healthy circumstances. This happens for a variety of different reasons, but the condition comes about by two ways &#8211; the submissive participant becomes conditioned
      to allow the manipulation to occur and/or the dominant one initiates the manipulation. In either case the rule still holds true &#8211; the one who needs the other the least has the most
      control. Nowhere is this more evident than in interpersonal relationships.</p>
    <p>
      Too many people who I counsel and read my posts (here and elsewhere) assume that this Rule means that I&#8217;m advocating the maintaining a position of dominance at the expense of their
      partners; far from it. I do however advocate that people &#8211; young men in particular &#8211; develop a better sense of self-worth and a better understanding of their true efficacy in their
      relationships (assuming you decide to become involved in one). Don&#8217;t get me wrong, both sexes are guilty of manipulation; Battered women go back to their abusive boyfriends/husbands and
      pussy whipped men compromise themselves and their ambitions to better serve their girlfriend’s insecurities. My intent in promoting this Rule is to open the eyes of young men who are already
      predisposed to devaluing themselves and placing women as the goal of their lives rather than seeing themselves as the PRIZE to be sought after. Compromise is always going to be a part of any
      relationship, but what&#8217;s key is realizing when that compromise becomes the result of manipulation, what is in effect, <span>then </span>developing the confidence to be uncompromising in
      those situations. This is where a firm understanding of the cardinal rule of relationships becomes essential.
    </p>
    <p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with backing down from an argument you have with your girlfriend, but there is something wrong when you continually compromise yourself in order to &#8216;keep
      the peace&#8217; with the understanding that she&#8217;ll withhold intimacy as a result of you holding your ground. That is a power play, also known as a &#8216;shit test&#8217;. She initiates
      it thus becoming the controlling party.</p>
    <p>
      No woman&#8217;s intimacy (i.e. sex) is <em>ever</em> worth that compromise because in doing so you devalue your own worth to her. Once this precident is set, she will progressively have less
      respect for you &#8211; exactly opposite of the popular conception that she&#8217;ll appreciate your compromising for her and reward you for your “sensitivity”.
    </p>
    <p>And really, what are you compromising in order to achieve? Set in this condition, her intimacy. That isn&#8217;t genuine desire or real interest in you, it&#8217;s a subtle psychological
      test (that all too many men are unaware of) meant to determine who needs the other more. There is no more a superior confidence for a man than one with the self-understanding that he will not
      compromise himself for the recognized manipulations of a woman, and the fortitude to walk away knowing he can and will find a better prospect than her. This is the man who passes the shit test.
      It&#8217;s called &#8216;enlightened self-interest&#8217; -— I cannot help others until I can help myself — and a principle I wholely endorse.</p>

    <h1>THE DESIRE DYNAMIC</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>You cannot negotiate Desire.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>This is a very simple principle that most Men and the vast majority of women are willfully ignorant of. One the most common personal problems I&#8217;ve been asked advice for in the past 10
      years is some variation of &#8220;how do I get her back?&#8221; Usually this breaks down into men seeking some methodology to return his relationship to an earlier state where a previously
      passionate woman couldn&#8217;t keep her hands off of him. Six months into a comfortable familiarity and the thrill is gone, but in truth it&#8217;s the genuine desire that is gone.</p>
    <p>It&#8217;s often at this stage that a man will resort to negotiation. Sometimes this can be as subtle as him progressively doing things for her in the hopes that she&#8217;ll reciprocate
      with the same sexual fervor they used to have. Other times a married couple may go to marriage counseling to &#8220;resolve their sex issues&#8221; and negotiate terms for her sexual compliance.
      He&#8217;ll promise to do the dishes and a load of laundry more often in exchange for her feigned sexual interest in him. Yet, no matter what terms are offered, no matter how great an external
      effort he makes so deserving of reward, the genuine desire is not there for her. In fact, she feels worse for not having the desire after such efforts were made for her compliance.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Negotiated desire only ever leads to obligated compliance.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>This is why her post-negotiation sexual response is often so lackluster and the source of even further frustration on his part. She may be more sexually available to him, but the
      half-hearted experience is never the same as when they first met when there was no negotiation, just spontaneous desire for each other.</p>
    <p>From a male perspective, and particularly that of an uninitiated beta male, negotiation of desire seems a rational solution to the problem. Men tend to innately rely on deductive reasoning;
      otherwise known as an &#8220;if then&#8221; logic stream. The code is often something like this:</p>
    <p>I need sex + women have the sex I want + query women about their conditions for sex + meet prerequisites for sex = the sex I want.</p>
    <p>
      Makes sense right? It&#8217;s simple economics, but built on a foundation that relies on a woman&#8217;s accurate self-evaluations. The genuine desire they used to experience at the outset of
      their relationship was predicated upon a completely unknown set of variables. Overtly communicating a desire for reciprocal desire creates obligation, and sometimes even ultimatums. Genuine
      desire is something a person must come to &#8211; or be led to &#8211; on their own volition. You can force a woman by threat to comply with behaving in a desired manner, but you cannot make her
      <em>want</em> to behave that way. A prostitute will fuck you for an exchange, it doesn&#8217;t mean she wants to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether LTR or a one night stand (ONS) strive for genuine desire in your relationships. Half of the battle is knowing you want to be with a woman who <em>wants</em> to please you, not one who
      feels obligated to. You will never draw this genuine desire from her by overt means, but you can covertly lead her to this genuine desire. The trick in provoking real desire is in keeping her
      ignorant of your intent to provoke it. Real desire is created by her thinking it&#8217;s something she wants, not something she has to do.
    </p>
    <h1>SCHEDULES OF MATING</h1>
    <p>
      There are methods and social contrivances women have used for centuries to ensure that the best male&#8217;s genes are selected and secured with the best male provisioning she&#8217;s capable of
      attracting. Ideally the best Man should exemplify both, but <strong>rarely do the two exist in the same male</strong> (particularly these days) so in the interest of achieving her biological
      imperative, and prompted by an innate need for security, the feminine as a whole had to develop social conventions and methodologies (which change as her environment and personal conditions do)
      to effect this. Men are not only up against a female genetic imperative, but also centuries long feminine social conventions established and adapted from a time long before human beings could
      accurately determine genetic origins.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#8217;ve detailed in many prior threads that mate selection is a psycho-biological function that millennia of evolution has hardwired into both sexes. So internalized and socialized is this
      process into our collective psyches that we rarely recognize we&#8217;re subject to these motivators even when we continually repeat the same behaviors manifested by them (such as having the <em>second</em>
      kid with the Alpha Bad Boy). So saying that we&#8217;re not subject to conditions we&#8217;re or are only vaguely aware of is a bit naive.
    </p>
    <p>It&#8217;s simple deductive logic to follow that for a species to survive it must provide its offspring with the best possible conditions to ensure its survival &#8211; either that or to
      reproduce in such quantity that it ensures survival. The obvious application of this for women is sharing parental investment with the best possible mate her own genetics allow her to attract
      and who can provide long term security for her and any potential offspring. Thus women are biologically, psychologically and sociologically the filters of their own reproduction, where as
      men&#8217;s reproductive methodology is to scatter as much of his genetic material as humanly possible to the widest available quantity of sexually available females. He of course has his own
      criteria for mating selection and determining the best genetic pairing for his reproduction (i.e. she&#8217;s gotta be hot), but his criteria is certainly less discriminating than that for women
      (i.e. no one&#8217;s ugly after 2am). This is evidenced in our own hormonal biology; men possess between 12 and17 times the amount of testosterone (the primary hormone in sexual arousal) women
      do and women produce substantially more estrogen (instrumental in sexual caution) and oxytocin (fostering feelings of security and nurturing) than men.</p>
    <p>That stated, both of these methodologies conflict in practice. For a woman to best ensure the survival of her young, a man must necessarily abandon his method of reproduction in favor of
      her own. This then sets a contradictory imperative for him to pair with a woman who will satisfy his methodology. A male must sacrifice his reproductive schedule to satisfy that of the woman he
      pairs with. Thus, with so much genetic potential at stake on his part of the risk, he want&#8217;s not only to ensure that she is the best possible candidate for breeding (and future breeding),
      but also to know that his progeny will benefit from both parent&#8217;s investment.</p>
    <p>Side note: One interesting outcome of this psycho-biological dynamic is men&#8217;s ability to spot their own children in a crowd of other children more quickly and with greater acuity than
      even their mothers. Studies have shown that men have the ability to more quickly and accurately identify their own children in a room full of kids dressed in the same uniforms than the mothers
      of the child. Again, this stresses the subconscious importance of this genetic trade off.</p>
    <p>These are the rudiments of human sexual selection and reproduction. There are many other social, emotional, psychological intricacies that are associated with these fundamentals, but they
      are the underlying motivations and considerations that subconsciously influence sexual selection.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Social Convention</strong><br /> To counter this subconscious dynamic to their own genetic advantage women initiate social conventions and psychological schemas to better facilitate
      their own breeding methodologies. This is why women always have the &#8220;prerogative to change her mind&#8221; and the most fickle of behaviors become socially excusable, while men&#8217;s
      behavior is constrained to a higher standard of responsibility to &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; which is invariably to the advantage of a woman&#8217;s reproductive scheme . This is why guys
      who are &#8216;Players&#8217;, and fathers who abandon mothers to pursue their innate reproduction method are villains, and fathers who selflessly sacrifice themselves financially, emotionally
      and life decision-wise, often to the benefit of children they didn&#8217;t father, are considered social heroes for complying with women&#8217;s genetic imperatives.
    </p>
    <p>This is also the root motivation for female-specific social dynamics such as LJBF rejections, women&#8217;s propensity for victimhood (as they&#8217;ve learned that this engenders
      &#8216;savior&#8217; mental schemas for men&#8217;s breeding schedules &#8211; Cap&#8217;n Save a Ho) and even marriage itself.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Good Dads vs Good Genes</strong><br /> The two greatest difficulties for women to overcome in their own methodology is that they are only at a sexually viable peak for a short window of
      time (generally their 20s) and the fact that the qualities that make a good long term partner (the Good Dad) and the qualities that make for good breeding stock (Good Genes) only rarely manifest
      themselves in the same male. Provisioning and security potential are fantastic motivators for pairing with a Good Dad, but the same characteristics that make him such are generally a
      disadvantage when compared with the man who better exemplifies genetic, physical attraction and the risk taking qualities that would imbue her child with a better capacity to adapt to its
      environment (i.e stronger, faster, more attractive than others to ensure the passing of her own genetic material to future generations). This is the Jerk vs. Nice Guy paradox writ large on an
      evolutionary scale.
    </p>
    <p>Men and women innately (though unconsciously) understand this dynamic, so in order for a woman to have the best that the Good Dad has to offer while taking advantage of the best that the
      Good Genes man has, she must invent and constantly modify social conventions to keep the advantage in her biological favor.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Reproductive Schedules</strong><br /> This paradox then necessitates that women (and by default men) must subscribe to short term and long term schedules of mating. Short term schedules
      facilitate breeding with the Good Genes male, while long term breeding is reserved the Good Dad male. This convention and the psycho-social schemas that accompany it are precisely why women will
      marry the Nice Guy, stable, loyal, (preferably) doctor and still fuck the pool boy or the cute surfer she met on spring break. In our genetic past, a male with good genes implied an ability to
      be a good provider, but modern convention has thwarted this, so new social and mental schemas had to be developed for women.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cheating</strong><br /> For this dynamic and the practicality of enjoying the best of both genetic worlds, women find it necessary to &#8216;cheat&#8217;. This cheating can be done
      proactively or reactively.
    </p>
    <p>In the reactive model, a woman who has already paired with her long term partner choice, engages in a extramarital or extra-pairing, sexual intercourse with a short term partner (i.e. the
      cheating wife or girlfriend). That&#8217;s not to say this short term opportunity cannot develop into a 2nd, long term mate, but the action of infidelity itself is a method for securing better
      genetic stock than the committed male provider is capable of supplying.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Proactive cheating</strong> is the single Mommy dilema. This form of &#8216;cheating&#8217; relies on the woman breeding with a Good Genes male, bearing his children and then abandoning
      him, or having him abandon her, (again through invented social conventions) in order to find a Good Dad male to provide for her and the children of her Good Genes partner to ensure their
      security.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to stress again that (most) women do not have some consciously constructed and recognized master plan to enact this cycle and deliberately trap men into it. Rather, the motivations for
      this behavior and the accompanying social rationales invented to justify it are an unconscious process. For the most part, women are unaware of this dynamic, but are nonetheless subject to its
      influence. <strong><em>For a female of any species to facilitate a methodology for breeding with the best genetic partner she&#8217;s able to attract AND to ensure her own and her
          offspring&#8217;s survival with the best provisioning partner; this is an evolutionary jackpot</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Cuckold</strong><br /> On some level of consciousness, men innately sense something is wrong with this situation, though they may not be able to place why they feel it or
      misunderstand it in the confusion of women&#8217;s justifications for it. Or they become frustrated by the social pressures to &#8216;do the right thing&#8217;, are shamed into
      martyrdom/savior-hood and committed to a feigned responsibility to these conventions. Nevertheless, some see it well enough to steer clear of single mothers, either by prior experience or
      observing other male cuckolds saddled with the responsibility of raising and providing for &#8211; no matter how involved or uninvolved &#8211; another man&#8217;s successful reproduction
      efforts with this woman.
    </p>
    <p>Men often fall into the role of the proactive or reactive Cuckold. He will never enjoy the same benefits as his mates short term partner(s) to the same degree, in the way of sexual desire
      or immediacy of it, while at the same time enduring the social pressures of having to provide for this Good Genes father&#8217;s progeny. It could be argued that he may contribute minimally to
      their welfare, but on some level, whether emotional, physical, financial or educational he will contribute some effort for another man&#8217;s genetic stock in exchange for a limited form of
      sexuality/intimacy from the mother. To some degree, (even if only by his presence) he is sharing the parental investment that should be borne by the short term partner. If nothing else, he
      contributes the time and effort to her he could be better invested in finding a sexual partner with which he could pursue his own genetic imperative by his own methodology.</p>
    <p>However, needless to say, there is no shortage of men sexually deprived enough to &#8216;see past&#8217; the long term disadvantages, and not only rewarding, but reinforcing a single
      mother&#8217;s bad decisions (bad from his own interest&#8217;s POV) with regard to her breeding selections and schedules in exchange for short term sexual gratification. Furthermore, by
      reinforcing her behavior thusly, he reinforces the social convention for both men and women. It&#8217;s important to bear in mind that in this age women are ultimately, soley responsible for the
      men they choose to mate with (baring rape of course) AND giving birth to their children. Men do bear responsibility for their actions no doubt, but it is ultimately the decision of the female
      and her judgement that decides her and her children&#8217;s fate</p>

  <h1>BUFFERS</h1>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      <strong>Rejection is better than Regret</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>Sifting through some of my past posts on the SoSuave forum it hit me; over 90% of what I advocate there can be reduced to overcoming a fear of rejection. 90% of the dilemas AFCs and rAFCs
      find themselves in, and a majority of men&#8217;s concerns, with the opposite sex find their roots in the methods and means they use to reduce their exposure to female rejection. These are
      buffers meant to reduce the potential for this rejection of intimacy. Men of course aren&#8217;t the only ones who use buffers &#8211; women have their share as well &#8211; but I think it would
      be much more productive for guys to recognize this propensity in themselves and see the methods they use, and often ego-invest in their personal psychologies, to buffer themselves against
      rejection.</p>

      Virtually every common problem guys deal with finds it&#8217;s basis in these buffers:<br /> <strong>LDRs &#8211;</strong> Long Distance Relationships. The AFC will entertain an LDR because it
      was based on a previous acceptance of intimacy and being no longer convenient (due to distance) the guy will cling to the &#8220;relationship&#8221; because it&#8217;s a buffer against potential
      rejection from new women instead of accepting the relationship as being finished and maturely re-entering the dating pool. It&#8217;s a perceived &#8220;sure thing&#8221;, even if only rarely
      rewarding.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Playing Friends &#8211;</strong> Usually after an LJBF rejection where the perception is the potential love interest &#8220;might&#8221; later become an intimate with time and
      qualification. No matter how misguided, the time and effort spent by an AFC in proving himself as the would-be &#8220;perfect boyfriend&#8221; is a buffer against further rejection by new
      potential females, which is then further compounded by a moralistic sense of duty to be an actual Friend to his LJBF girl. In essence, his buffer against further rejection is his misplaced
      dedication to the LJBF girl. Another variation of this is the Cap&#8217;n-Save-A-Ho dynamic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Emails, IMs and Texts &#8211;</strong> I should also add lengthy phone conversations to this list as well, but really any technology that seemingly increases comunication serves as a
      buffer (for both genders) the more it limits interpersonal communication. In the AFC case, the rationalization is that it keeps him in constant contact with his sex interest (which in and of
      itself is a mistake), but only serves as a buffer against her rejection. The latent peception being that it&#8217;s easier to read a rejection (or hear one) than to potentially be rejected in
      person. A lot of guys will counter this with how Texts and IM&#8217;s are just how this generation plies it&#8217;s Game. The difference I&#8217;d argue is that when digital communication
      becomes your <em>preferred</em> method of interacting with women, it&#8217;s a buffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Facebook &amp; Online Dating &#8211;</strong> This one should be fairly obvious for the same reasons as above &#8211; Online dating is perhaps the best buffer ever conceived &#8211;
      particularly for less than physically ideal women. In fact it&#8217;s so effective that businesses can be built upon the common insecurities and fear of rejection of both sexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Objectification of Gender &#8211; </strong>This might be less obvious, but both sexes tend to objectify the other. Naturally when we think of this, the popularized notion is that men
      objectify women as sex objects, but women have a tendency to objectify men as &#8220;success objects&#8221; for the same reason. It is easier to accept rejection from an object than it is to
      take it from a living, breathing, human being. This is why we refer to intergender communication as a &#8220;game.&#8221; We &#8220;score&#8221; or we get &#8220;shot down&#8221; not personally
      or emotionally rejected; the buffer is in the language and mental approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Idealization of Gender &#8211;</strong> This is the myth of the &#8220;Quality Woman.&#8221; The buffer operates in perceived self-limitations based on a search for an ideal mate. Thus a
      tendency to fixate on one woman (ONEitis) or one type of woman (a gender Archetype) develops. By limiting to, and/or fixating on one woman (or type) the potential for rejection decreases, while
      insuring that any real rejection will come only from what will later be deemed non-qualified women. Rejection = &#8216;Low Quality Woman&#8217; and is thus disqualified. This works in a similar
      fashon to the objectification buffer in that the woman delivering the rejection is reduced to an object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scarcity Mentality &#8211;</strong> The &#8220;Take What I Can Get and Be Glad I Got It&#8221; mentality acts as a buffer in that it works opposite of the Idealization buffer.
      Deprivation is motivation, and by sticking with the &#8220;sure thing&#8221; as the &#8220;only thing&#8221;, the potential for new rejection is then eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Older Women, Younger Women &#8211; </strong>I should also include certain body types in this category as well, but the buffer is in certain types of women being less likely to reject a
      man due to their personal circumstances. The Cougar dynamic debate has been done into irrelevancy, but the buffer is that older women, acting in accordance with their conditions, will be more
      inclined to accept the advances of younger men. In the same vein, very young girls will be more apt to accept the advances of older men due to naiveté and fat women are easier to become intimate
      with due to sexual deprivation. This isn&#8217;t rocket science, but an internalized preference for particular women develop by associating that particular type of woman with the minimization
      for potential rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Leagues</strong> &#8211; This is the opposite of a &#8220;high standards&#8221; buffer which could be grouped with Scarcity. There is the woman some guys actually fear because she is
      perceived to be so much more socially valuable than the AFC. Think of the HB9+ corporate director who runs marathons, travels a lot, has good friends, dresses well, etc, etc, etc. The AFC tells
      himself &#8220;wow is she out of my league I would just get shot down because I would need to possess A, B &amp; C to be her social status equal for her to even be interested&#8221;. Ergo, the
      idea of Leagues is a useful rationalization buffer against rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pornography</strong> I realize this will draw some fire from the masturbation / no-masturbation set, but porn (as men use it) is a Buffer against rejection. Porn doesn&#8217;t talk back,
      porn doesn&#8217;t need a few drinks to loosen up nor does porn require any social skills to produce rewards. It&#8217;s convenient, immediate, sexual release that requires nothing more than a
      PC and an internet connection (or a magazine if you prefer the analog means). We can argue the obsessive-compulsive aspect of it, or the &#8220;my GF and I enjoy porn together&#8221; reasoning,
      but for the single guy the root reasoning is it&#8217;s facility as a Buffer. I should also add that it&#8217;s this very facility that makes women hate it (when they do). Porn gives a guy his
      reward for free; a reward that should be her single best agency is rendered valueless when a man can get off to an infinite variety of sexual experience at the click of a mouse. It&#8217;s
      unlimited access to unlimited sexual availability without the stress of learning methods to earn it as a reward.
    </p>
    <p>These are really just a few notable examples, but once you become aware of how buffers manifest you&#8217;ll begin to see how and why they are useful against rejection. Buffers are
      generally the paths of least rejection that become ego-invested &#8220;preferences.&#8221; Buffers aren&#8217;t so much about those &#8220;preference&#8221; as they are about the motivations
      behind them.</p>
    <p>
      At this point you might be thinking, &#8220;well, what the hell, I don&#8217;t want to feel rejection, why not employ buffers against it?&#8221; The main reason for embracing rejection is that <strong>rejection
        is better than regret</strong>. Scan back through this short list of buffers; how many of these have become greater, longer term problems for you than a briefly painful rejection would&#8217;ve been?
      Buffers also have a tendency to compound upon themselves in that one tends to dovetail into another, or more, until you no longer realize that they were originally rejection prevention
      methodologies and gradually become associated with your genuine personality. After a long enough period, these buffer become &#8220;just how I am.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best. Rejection, real, raw, in your face rejection stings like a bitch. It must be something so intolerable that human beings will devise
      countless social and psychological constructs in order to avoid it. However, there is no better teacher than getting burned by the stove. As a Man, you are going to face rejection in far more
      facets of your life than just dealing with a woman. The buffers you learn in one aspect of your life will be just as encumbering when they&#8217;re transferred to another aspect of your life.
      All of these buffers listed, and many more, become indicators of how you confidently deal with adversity. Some make you look like a beta-herb pussy, others are subtle and nagging parts of an
      internalized personality, but dependence upon them incrementally reveals your real character to a woman. Are you Alpha enough to take a rejection on the chin, smile and confidently come back for
      more? Or will you run, will you block yourself, will you hide with convenient buffers?</p>

  <h1>IMAGINATION</h1>

  <div id="post_message_1700798">
    A woman&#8217;s imagination is the single most useful tool in your Game arsenal. Every technique, every casual response, every gesture, intimation and subcommunication hinges on stimulating her
    imagination. Competition anxiety relies on it. DHV relies on it. Sexual tension (gina tingles) relies on it. Call it &#8220;Caffeinating the Hamster&#8221; if you will, but stimulating a
    woman&#8217;s imaginings is the single most potent talent you can learn in any context of a relationship (LTR, STR, ONS, Plate Spinning.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the single greatest failing of average frustrated chumps; they vomit out everything about themselves, divulging the full truth of themselves to women in the mistaken belief that women
      desire that truth as a basis for qualifying for their intimacy. Learn this now: <strong>Women NEVER want full disclosure</strong>. Nothing is more self-satisfying for a woman than to think
      she&#8217;s figured a Man out based solely on her mythical feminine intuition (i.e. imagination).
    </p>
    <p>When a man overtly confirms his character, his story, his value, etc. for a woman, the mystery is dispelled and the bio-chemical rush she enjoyed from her imaginings, her suspicions, her
      self-confirmations about you are GONE. AFCs classically do exactly this on the first date and wonder why they get LJBF&#8217;d promptly after it &#8211; this is why. Familiarity is
      anti-seductive. Nothing kills Game, lust and libido like comfortable familiarity. Despite their common bleating filibuster tactics, women don&#8217;t want to be comfortable with a potential (or
      proven) sex partner, they need their imaginations stoked to be excited, aroused and anxious to want sex with a potential partner.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    In an LTR there&#8217;s an even more critical need to keep prodding that imagination. I would go so far as to say it&#8217;s imperative for a healthy relationship, but then you&#8217;ll ask, how
    do you go about that when your LTR GF or wife already knows your story and the familiarity becomes cemented in?
    </p>
    <p>
      The easy answer is never let it be from the outset &#8211; <strong>the health of any LTR you might entertain depends and survives on the frame you enter into it with</strong>. The foundations of
      a healthy LTR are laid while you&#8217;re single and dating non-exclusively. I&#8217;ve yet to meet the guy who&#8217;s told me he&#8217;s getting more frequent, more intense sex <em>after</em>
      his LTR / Marriage / Live-in situation was established. The primary reason for this is the relaxation of the competition anxiety that made the urgency of fucking you with lustful abandon in your
      dating phase an imperative to get you to commit to her frame. And that&#8217;s the crux of the matter that so many guys fail in, they surrender the frame BEFORE they commit to an LTR. They
      believe, (thanks to their Matrix conditioning) that commitment is synonymous with acquiescing to her frame control. Combine this with anti-seductive familiarity and the growing commonness of
      your own value because of it, and you can see exactly why her sexual interest wanes.
    </p>
    <p>So what do you do to prevent that? First and foremost, understand that whose frame you enter into an LTR sets the foundation of that LTR. If you find yourself buying into an
      &#8220;it&#8217;s women&#8217;s world and we just live in it&#8221; mentality where your default presumption is that commitment means she wins, you lose and that&#8217;s just how it is,
      don&#8217;t even consider an LTR. She enters your world, not the other way around.</p>
    <p>
      Secondly, you need to cultivate an element of unpredictability about yourself prior to, and into, an LTR. Always remember POOK&#8217;s proverb, <strong>Perfect is BORING.</strong> Women will cry
      a river about wanting Mr. Dependable and then go off to fuck Mr. Exciting. In an LTR it&#8217;s necessary to be both, but not one at the expense of the other. Too many married men are TERRIFIED
      to rock the excitement boat with their wives because their sex lives hang in the balance of placating to her and her already preset frame. She must be reminded daily why you&#8217;re fun,
      unpredictable and exciting, not only to her, but other women as well. This requires covertly implying that other women find you desirable. Women crave the chemical rush that comes from suspicion
      and indignation. If you don&#8217;t provide it, they&#8217;ll happily get it from tabloids, romance novels, The View, Tyra Banks or otherwise living vicariously through their single girlfriends.
    </p>
    <p>By playfully staying her source of that rush you maintain the position of stimulating her imagination. Married men, who were defeated before they committed, don&#8217;t think that elements
      of Game apply to marriage out of fear of upsetting their wives frame, when in fact C&amp;F and Negs and many other aspects of Game work wonderfully. Just kicking her in the ass or busting her
      chops, playfully, is sometimes enough to send the message that you&#8217;re fearless of her response. You can break her frame with cockiness and the imaginings that come with it.</p>
    <p>Breaking from an established, predictable familiarity is often a great way to fire her imagination. Married guys will report how sexual their wives become after they get to the gym and
      start shaping up after a long layoff (or for the first time). It&#8217;s easy to pass this off as looking better makes women more aroused (which is true), but underneath that is the breaking of
      a pattern. You&#8217;re controllable and predictable so long as you&#8217;re pudgy and listless &#8211; what other woman would want you? But start changing your patterns, get into shape, make
      more money, get a promotion, improve and demonstrate your higher value in some appreciable way and the imagination and competition anxiety returns.</p>
  </div>
  <h1>SOCIAL MATCHING THEORY</h1>
  <img src="img/books/red2.jpeg">
  <p>
    <em>How to spot a rich guy</em>
  </p>
  <p>We laugh our asses off at this joke, but why is it funny? It is funny because human beings, like many other higher order animals, have the innate ability to make cognitive comparisons on a
    subconscious level. The reason it&#8217;s humorous is because we see an imbalance in a system and make deductive conclusions with regard to individual conditions. This is the basis of the Social
    Matching Theory.</p>
  <p>
    Social Matching Theory, in essence, is defined as follows: <em>All things being equal, an individual will tend to be attracted to, and are more likely to pair off with, another individual who
      is of the same or like degree of physical attractiveness as themself.</em>
  </p>
  <p>Just as an aside, this is a well recognized social psychology theory, not something manufactured by Game theorists. However, in a nutshell it outlines the sexual marketplace dynamic, before
    adding variables like Game, status, provisioning, etc.</p>
  <p>This is a naturally occuring commonality among many specific aculturations and societies. The trick to this theory is of course that &#8216;All Things&#8217; are rarely equal. However, my
    point to this isn&#8217;t to naively assume that attraction and sexual pairing happen in a vacuum &#8211; far from it. It is to illustrate an underlying psycho-biological principle that operates
    beneath our consciousness that prompts other psychological schemas from an intimately personal (micro) level to the social psychology of an entire (macro) culture.</p>
  <p>As I&#8217;ve posted in several forum threads with regard to &#8220;Why Women Cheat&#8221; or why men are so compelled toward sex with archetypically attractive women, the root of this desire
    is a psychologically evolved opportunism that is founded on our ability to make and assess these natural comparissons in order to better facilitate our own survival and the survival of our
    offspring. It has served our species so well over millennia that this natural comparisson making capacity has become an autonomous and subconscious aspect of experiencing our environment. We
    understand that eating a large apple is preferable, from a survial standpoint, to eating the small one. We have a tendency to want what our biologies compel us towards and develop idealizations
    based on what we think would best satisfy these ends.</p>
  <p>As I stated, I understand that attraction and intersexual relations do not happen in a vacumm and there are many (generally predictable) variables that influence this, but Social Matching
    Theory isn&#8217;t about the process of attraction or pairing so much as the motivations for selection. I&#8217;m often asked about the importance placed on physical appearance, prowess, etc.
    bearing influence on attraction, and I can speak from my own experience saying yes, it absolutely does. A fat guy is simply not going to attract a Fitness America competitor without some very
    unique circumstances influencing this attraction. Neither would I support this attraction being based in a qualitative, genuine physical desire for the fat male. It is an imbalance in a system.</p>
  <p>All things being equal; socio-economic, intellectual, emotional levels etc. you will have a tendency to attract and be attracted to people of similar physical presence as yourself. This is
    the root of the psychological schema many men and women apply when they follow the &#8220;He/She&#8217;s out of my leauge&#8221; mentality. They are manifesting this subconscious understanding
    that the prospects of another person of a more idealized physical presence being attracted to them or pairing with them would be an unlikely match. They self-perceive this imbalance and thus limit
    themselves to opportunities that have a better likelihood of success in gratifying their need &#8211; in this case sex.</p>
  <p>Look at the &#8216;Rich Guy&#8217; picture again. The woman in this imbalance we might presume is a &#8216;Golddigger&#8217;. This too is inspired by an innate understanding of the Social
    Matching Theory. Why else would an (arguably) attractive woman in comparatively good shape, wearing a thong (indicating sexual availability), be with a morbidly obese male if he didn&#8217;t
    posess some other redeeming variable to inspire the match? We see a picture and laugh, and women make the internalized rationalization that she&#8217;s not genuinely interested in the guy, but is
    &#8216;in love&#8217; with his provisioning means. Superficial? Perhaps, but it still illustrates this comparative instinct we have, particularly when we know nothing about individual
    circumstance. The possibility does exists that this woman genuinely loves the guy, or is attracted to him, but this isn&#8217;t our first impression. In fact it takes significant, trained, mental
    effort to consider the possibility because the Social Matching comparison IS our natural default.</p>
  <p>Finally, I should add that the Social Matching Theory is also one of the primary foundations upon which AFCism and ONEitis is based. This natural fear of rejection associated with both of
    these schema stem from a subconscious understanding of this theory. ONEitis in particular can be traced back to this self-perception of imbalance leading to the &#8220;I&#8217;ll never find a
    better woman/man than this person&#8221; mentality in so much as it represents a limitation of opportunism. In other words, it becomes preferable for a person to stay and accomodate an otherwise
    intolerable relationship if that person has internalized the understanding that their relationship represents an imbalance in this Social Matching. Abuse endured from the more idealized mate
    becomes preferable to rejection from anonymous, less idealized sources of intimacy.</p>
  <p>At this point you may be wondering what brought this post to the surface. I recently got into a debate with a self-described feminist who entirely rejected notion that a sexual marketplace
    should even exist in contemporary human society. It wasn&#8217;t that she was denying the underlying dynamic of the sexual marketplace, but rather that it was an antiquated and dehumanizing
    influence in the human condition. Up until this conversation, I&#8217;d always taken the idea of a sexual marketplace and sexual market value as applied to individuals as a given. The SMP was a
    recognized universal framework in which we maneuver &#8211; some successfully, others with difficulty. The rejection of this idea, or the desire to alter it sociological, seems absurd to me, even
    though I would agree that it is a brutal game we play. My counterargument with her was that the SMP is actually more representative of our humanity, in that it&#8217;s healthier to accept that the
    way we evolved as a successful species was due to the harsh reality of the SMP. She wouldn&#8217;t hear it.</p>

  <h1>ALPHA</h1>

  <p>
    <em>The Alpha Buddah, Corey Worthington.</em>
  </p>
  <p>What I&#8217;m about to type here is not going to make me any new friends. I know because any discussion of what constitutes Alpha characteristics in a Man always becomes clouded by the
    self-perceptions of how well we think we align with them. As I&#8217;ve covered in prior postings, the &#8216;community&#8217;, the &#8216;manosphere&#8217;, the new understanding of gender
    relations that&#8217;s picked up momentum for the last 12 years has always generated it&#8217;s own terminologies for more abstract concepts. The danger in this is that these terms lack real,
    universal definition. For purposes of illustrating a concept these terms are usually serviceable – we have a general understanding of what makes for a &#8216;Beta&#8217; or a Herb, or a man who
    falls into a &#8216;provider&#8217; mentality. Even &#8216;Alpha&#8217; in a specific context is useful as an illustrative tool, when the subject isn&#8217;t directly about
    &#8216;Alpha-ness&#8217;. It&#8217;s when we try to universally define what constitutes Alpha that the sparks start to fly. So before you continue on reading further, think about what you believe
    makes a guy Alpha. Got it in your head now? Good, now put all of that aside, purge that from your head, and read the next few paragraphs from the perspective that you don&#8217;t know anything
    about Alpha.</p>
  <p>
    I was first introduced to the Alpha Buddah courtesy of Roissy and this post <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2009/08/12/umm-sorry/">&#8220;Umm, sorry?&#8221;</a> You can go ahead and read
    this from the Chateau&#8217;s perspective, and I think the analysis is pretty good. I call Corey the Alpha Buddah not in the hopes that men will aspire to his almost Zen like &#8216;being&#8217;
    in Alpha, but rather to provide an example of Alpha in it&#8217;s most pure form. He literally IS Alpha, unclouded by pretense, afterthought, or conscious awareness of any influence that could
    have a hope of prompting introspection about his state.
  </p>
  <p>Corey Worthington is a piss poor example of a human being, but he&#8217;s a textbook example of Alpha. I could use a lot of adjectives to describe this kid, but &#8220;beta&#8221;
    wouldn&#8217;t be one of them. What&#8217;s funny, and a bit ironic, is this kid has probably never come across Mystery Method or &#8220;the community&#8221; or even heard of
    &#8216;peacocking&#8217; and he gets naturally what millions of guys pay small fortunes at PUA seminars to acquire over the course of a lifetime. He&#8217;s a selfish little prick, but what makes
    him insulting to &#8216;normal&#8217; men is his having the natural, internalized Alpha bravado so many AFCs wish they had. If you could bottle and sell this Alpha essence, you&#8217;d be rich
    beyond imagine.</p>
  <p>Right about now all of those self-affirming preconceptions you had about Alpha-ness (that I told you to stow away before reading this) are probably yelling to be let out of the mental box you
    put them in. &#8220;,..but, but Rollo, how can you possibly think this arrogant douchebag kid could ever be an example of anything remotely Alpha?!&#8221; You&#8217;ll be pleased to know I fully
    empathize your outrage. You work hard to be a &#8220;better man&#8221;, you put in the self analysis, you paid your dues coming to terms with unplugging and reinventing yourself. You&#8217;re a
    success, Corey is fuck-up. Corey&#8217;s not a better Man than you are, however, he understands Alpha better than you do.</p>
  <p>Alpha is mindset, not a demographic.</p>
  <p>Alpha is as Alpha does, it isn&#8217;t what we say it is. There are noble Alphas and there are scoundrel Alphas, the difference is all in how they apply themselves. There&#8217;s a tendency
    to approach every &#8220;Alpha&#8221; argument from what a guy thinks is righteousness; ergo, his personal definition of Alpha is what appeals best to his sense of virtue. He earned his Alpha
    cred, played by the rules, and by God people (women) should respect that. However, the sad truth is that prisons are full of Alpha males who simply channeled their drive toward destructive and
    anti-social endeavors. There are plenty of examples of indifferent Asshole Alphas who you wouldn&#8217;t say are upstanding moral leaders at all, yet women will literally kill each other (or
    themselves) in order to bang them because they exude a natural Alpha-ness. Just as Corey does here. There are Alpha drug dealing gang leaders, and there are Alpha husbands, fathers and leaders of
    industry. It&#8217;s all in the application. Genghis Khan was Alpha as fuck, and a leader-of-men, but probably would be on most people&#8217;s douchebag list for that era. Here&#8217;s an
    illustration:</p>

  <p>Guy&#8217;s like Corey infuriate men who have invested their self-worth in the accomplishments of what they think ought to be universally appreciated and rewarded. So when they&#8217;re
    confronted with a natural Alpha being undeservedly rewarded for brazenly acting out of accord with what they think the rules ought to be, they seethe with resentment. The natural response in the
    face of such an inconsistency is to redefine the term &#8216;Alpha&#8217; to cater to themselves and their accomplishments as &#8220;real men&#8221; and exclude the perpetrator. The conflict then
    comes from seeing his new definition of Alpha not being rewarded or even appreciated as well as a natural Alpha attitude and the cycle continues. Your respect (or anyone else&#8217;s) for an Alpha
    has nothing to do with whether or not he possess an Alpha mindset. 3 failed marriages and 100+ lays has nothing to do with his having or not having an Alpha mindset. There are many well respected
    betas who&#8217;ve never had a passing thought of infidelity, or may have 300 lays either with prostitutes or because they possess fame or stunning good looks and women come to him by matter of
    course.</p>
  <p>The take home message here is that you are not Alpha because of your achievements, you have your achievements because you are Alpha. You possess a mindset you either had to develop or it came
    naturally to you. I constantly field questions from young men asking me whether some action or behavior they displayed to a woman was Alpha, or Alpha enough. The real answer is that Alpha
    behaviors are manifestations of an Alpha mindset. And just like Corey the Alpha Buddah, the introspect required to wonder if something was or wasn&#8217;t Alpha wouldn&#8217;t ever be a
    consideration enough to ask. You almost need to have a childlike understanding to really appreciate what Alpha really is. Kids get Alpha. Even the picked on, introverted, beta-to-be kid has a
    better understanding of Alpha than most adult men do because he lacks the abstract thinking required to rationalize Alpha for himself. Most men, by our socialization, and to varying degrees, lose
    this in-born Alpha mindset over time. The naturals, the Corey&#8217;s of the world, have a better grasp on it&#8217;s usefulness and repurpose it; either to their adulthood advantage or their
    detriment.</p>
