<h2>DON’T MARRY.</h2>

<p class="center largefont boldfont" style="margin-bottom:1.1em">BY HILDRETH.</p>


<p>It is not intended to advise against marriage, nor
to draw the line too closely as to the don’t-marry
class, but simply to hint at the errors of
some persons who match badly on so long a
contract.</p>

<p>The “yes or no” question is the vital one for all
young people to answer. Some answer too
soon, others wait too long, others never reach
such a climax of happiness as to be invited by
an eligible partner. The genius of selection is
the rarest of faculties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>What most puzzles the will and makes us bear
the ills we have is the theme of selection. A
mother’s or father’s view of a suitor may be at
variance with the daughter’s wish and destroy
the peace of both for a lifetime. But quite
generally the real trouble arises from a spiteful
choice or a hasty one, or one in some of the
forms here mentioned. Should these hints prevent
one unhappy marriage, they will well repay
the little study that their brevity requires.</p>

<p>To avoid much lecturing, only two examples are
given at any length, in the form of stories.
These are as near to the real characters as the
writer can safely relate them, being founded
on actual romantic and unromantic marriages.
As marriage is the first question that every
family will discuss, it is well to treat it with
exact candor.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry for beauty merely.</em> Very few have a
supply that would last a full dozen years in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
married life that should continue for three decades.</p>

<p>And, more than that, beauty is not the only requisite
to happiness. Very handsome people
are almost always vain, often exacting, and generally
live on their form, paying little or no attention
to the rarer qualities of manhood or
womanhood.</p>

<p>If one seek beauty alone, he will find it in the
fields and flowers and gardens, in paintings,
art works, and things of nature; while the real
pleasures of life may be found in a thousand
ways outside of the worship of beauty.</p>

<p>There are a dozen considerations beyond beauty
that should govern the choice of a companion.
Think for a moment whom you admire
most, trust implicitly, and love more ardently
than all others. Truly, it is not the wax-doll
face in a milliner’s window; were that so, why
not marry the model and get the perfection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
beauty? The day will come when the “rain
beats in at the heart windows.” The time may
run along so fast till the summer is over and
the winter snow-drifts shade your locks with
silver, when one by one of your friends will
visit at the fireside, when some one will love
you for your mind and heart and nobleness.
Some one suited to your silver-age condition
and disposition will be beautiful without any
name for beauty; as the soldier said of Grant’s
face, after Shiloh’s bloody battle, “That was
the handsomest face I ever saw;” yet it was
plain and dusty and rugged.</p>

<p>Prize-winners in matrimony have been women of
finer mould than mere beauties. Women who
have won the hearts of statesmen, and painters
and poets, and the good and great of all time,
were women of fascination, or what the Southern
ladies call sweet women, and not alone
noted for their beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Many a one has been known to have been plain
but social; not always unhandsome, but never
beautiful. They are the best wives and noblest
mothers who have more to commend them
than mere grace of features, shade of skin,
or color of eyes, or art of beautifying. Some
are frivolous, and more are flattered into danger.
The most miserable man I know is married to
one of the most beautiful women. He is
jealous; she is exposed to insults unawares.
Their home is a Hades six days out of seven.
I’ve heard him wish she were less attractive!</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a man for money.</em> If money is your
real object, the older and uglier he is, the better;
for nothing should come between you and
the chosen idol of your affection. If you marry
one for his money, he will find it out shortly.</p>

<p>What sublime contempt a man must have for one
who simply loves his pocket-book! Why not
love his farm, or lumber-yard, or herd of cattle?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The love of money is a miserly pretence
of affection that leads to discontent, distrust,
and disgust when they find it out.</p>

<p>Besides, wealthy men are men of care. The
wife of a noted millionnaire has had her husband’s
body stolen from its vault, has been long
kept in agony, is an object of pity to all who
know her. Another wife was heard to say,
“Why, I don’t have the privilege, nor the
money, nor the good times that my girl Bridget
enjoys. I am poor and anxious and depressed,
and weary of hearing my husband say,
over and over again, ‘You are fixing for the
poor-house.’ He really thinks and believes we
will end life in the poor-house; and yet he enjoys
a princely income.” Thousands of such
men carry their load of care, and load of
wealth, and load of anxiety, and how can they
carry any burden of love?</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a very small man</em>&mdash;a little fellow far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
below all proportion; try to get some form to
admire, something to shape things to, and
some one who is not lost in a crowd completely,
who is too little to admire and too small for
beauty. You may need strong arms and
brave hands to protect you. You will need
hands to provide for and maintain you, and a
good form is a fine beginning of manhood or
womanhood.</p>

<p>Mental greatness is not measured by size of
brain or bodily proportions. Great men are
neither always wise nor always large; they are
more often of more medium build, and well
balanced in gifts of mental and physical development.
Of the two, a very large man is
better than a small one, and a medium large
woman likewise.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry too young.</em> The right age to marry
is a matter of taste; twenty-one for girls, and
twenty-four for men may be a little arbitrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
but certainly is sensible. The happy early
marriages are rare. It too often happens that
love is mistaken, or poorly informed, or lacks
an anchor in good judgment. There is no use
of reasoning about it,&mdash;love is love, and will
marry in spite of reason, and in some cases it
runs away with its choice and repents it a
thousand times soon after.</p>

<p>But be sensible, for a life contract should be a
sensible one. What is the use of throwing
away one season&mdash;skipping girlhood or boyhood
to rush into maturity and maternity?
The records of divorce courts tell the silly and
sorrowful stories of many a mismated pair,
married too young and slowly repenting of
their rashness. Ask of your truest friends;
take counsel; be above foolishness.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a villain.</em> Many a girl is ripe for an
adventure, and in appearance nothing more
resembles an angel than a keen and designing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
villain&mdash;a thoroughbred; not a gambler merely,
but worse, a wreck! Such men may be wary,
artful, deceitful, attractive. They are crafty;
their trade compels it. They may be handsome,
often so; they may be oily and slick&mdash;most of
them are. They may live rich and expensive
lives for a season; ill-gotten gains are not lasting.
Heaven pity the girl that marries one
of these adventurers, for the end is bitterness!
A friend met one on the Pacific road,
married him, and learned to her sorrow that he
drank to excess, swore like a pirate, lived in
debauchery, and early offered to swap wives for
a season with a boon-companion. “And that
man,” she said, “was as handsome as a dude,
as slick as an auctioneer, as oily as a pedler; I
loved him only one day after marriage.”</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a hypocrite.</em> Of all things get sincerity.
Get the genuine article. If you get a
hypocrite, he is brass jewelry, and will easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
tarnish. Make careful inquiry, see that he is
all that he pretends to be, or never trust him.
The habit of deceit is one of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Some join churches for no other reason than to
cloak iniquity. It is not the rule by any
means; it is a too common exception. One
who goes from city to city and captivates too
many by his oil of blandness; one who has no
business, an idler; one who apes the rich and is
ground down in poverty; one who lacks the
courage to live like himself and had rather live
a lie and deceive the world around him,&mdash;is an
unfit companion, and will bear watching.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a coquette.</em> One that is worn out by
a long list of discarded admirers is like stale
bread&mdash;worse every day and seldom grows better
by long standing. There are women, and
girls sometimes, who glory and revel in the
names of discarded lovers; whose sense of honesty
has been poisoned, numbed, and frozen by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
cheating their victims through pretended affection,
until they have lost all heart or honesty;
who deserve to be left alone to ponder on their
cruelty for the balance of their miserable existence.
Of all the worst forms of flirting, coquetry
is the most detestable. It is not only
trifling away the time of both, but casting distrust
on the holiest of all sentiments, the purity
of womanhood. To steal money is honorable
compared to stealing affection.</p>

<p>The habit of coquetry will, or may, last long after
marriage. She who practises it will follow up
in unpleasant references to her conquests,
wishing she had married at this offer or that,
and wear out the happiness of her last conquest
by a frequent reminder of his inferiority to the
others.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a woman for her money.</em> These people
are tenacious to a minute degree. They
long to remind you of my house, my property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
my farm, my lots on Lincoln Avenue, my furniture,
my bank account, and the like&mdash;making
one a pensioner all his life for his board and
clothing. If there is any difference, it should be
with the man. He is expected to control property.
He is the master of his house, or the
manager of his expenses. Very naturally he
says “my” store or “my” lots, but it will sound
far more fair and considerate even if he says
“our” in lieu of “my” sometimes.</p>

<p>The only fair way to act about it is to treat marriage
as a partnership where nobody owns all,
but each has an equal interest. It is fair to
divide a good portion of one’s property with
his wife, fair to deed her a nice homestead and
present her a given allowance&mdash;liberal as one’s
income will warrant&mdash;and let her draw from it
as her own, and not be a beggar each time she
needs money.</p>

<p><em>Don’t elope to marry.</em> It is a weak affection that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
cannot wait awhile. Jacob served seven years,
then seven more, for Rebecca. She was a fine
specimen of womanhood&mdash;as represented in
paintings; housekeeping was easy and inexpensive
then, but they patiently waited and
were handsomely rewarded.</p>

<p>Ruth was an excellent example of girlhood. In
no great hurry to marry, taking the hardships
of travel, her devotion to her mother touched
the heart of a king, and she won a splendid
prize for her patience. She might have eloped
with a stage-driver or a coachman, and ended
her life with many less historical-society notices.</p>

<p><em>Don’t dally about proposing.</em> What is it to ask a
fine girl to marry you? The simplest, easiest
thing on earth, if you “strike while the iron is
hot.” Go about it sensibly. To begin with,
you never expect much encouragement from a
discreet maiden; she is in the background; her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
promise is to be invited; she is not her own
spokeswoman. Think of the embarrassment.</p>

<p>I venture to say, if you like her, that you will say
so. Often you may have told her how fine her
eyes are, or how well you like her singing, or
talking, and her company; but when you ask
a simple question, you get down on your knees
(they do in novels, not in reality) and beg for
it. Nonsense! Such a girl is unworthy. Begging
is a silly fashion, seldom now indulged in,
all out of date, and no longer tolerated outside
of novels and theatres. Use a little sense
about it.</p>

<p>Find out first if you have the right one, then settle
the matter in one of five ways: First, in the
parlor (don’t propose in church, or at a donation,
or in a crowd, or on a street-car, or while
the horse is prancing), get up your resolution
at the right moment and say: “Do we understand
each other, Clemantha?” Then, if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
doesn’t, explain it to her in a sensible fashion,
and in little short words that cannot be mistaken;
give her time, if necessary.</p>

<p>The second way is, on a fine walk or drive,
“Would you like to walk always?” or, “If you
were to choose whom you would walk with forever,
who would it be?” She will say, “I don’t
care to be so personal.” Certainly then you
may be more explicit.</p>

<p>Third, suppose you are to separate, what a grand
opportunity! See that you improve it earnestly.
To tell a girl that she is fairer than
flowers, clearer than coffee, and sweeter than
honey is old, very old, and uncalled-for. Tell
her she is what she is, and you like her with all
her surroundings; that you can better her condition
sometime. Dwell on the “sometime.”</p>

<p>Be honest about it. If she doesn’t love you, let
her love some one else, and you will be surprised
to find how many pure and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
beings there are all around you, holding their
finger-tips to hide a smile of welcome and
ready&mdash;“yes, Edgar”&mdash;eager to mate with one
worthy and ready to marry them, for marriage
is a natural hope of every right-minded woman.</p>

<p>This is a fourth method: read aloud of characters
like Arden, Romeo, or Abelard, or Paul
and Virginia, and make your comments audibly.
You will not be long in tracing a conclusion.
Be a little ingenious about it, find out
through your sister. Prepare the way and
don’t ask until you find she is unpledged, remember;
or at least tarry long enough to be
reasonably certain. And what if refused?
No harm done. Like the German’s sugar,
“The other pound is shust so good as the
first one.”</p>

<p>One man I know drew off a list of all his acquaintances
worthy of marriage, and went
about it like a regular wheat-buyer. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
bachelor, of course, and very eccentric. Coming
to the first, he explained his object, concealing
all names, but saying she was first of a long list
furnished him by a friend (each one was first,
always); then he would say, “I will give you a
week to consider it, and no harm done; if not
then, I must pursue my list further.” Of all
the sold-out men, he was sold the cheapest!
He married a whole family. The first two
were disgusted, the third or fourth accepted.
This looks too much like a purchase and sale,
and don’t try the method.</p>

<p>The last way is sensible; by writing&mdash;many a
proposal is in writing. Even in that be a little
guarded; once a no, yeses come with reluctance.
It is best not to give one an opportunity
to say no, but to parry long enough to test
the opposition. If it were a race-horse to buy,
a house to contract for, or a block to purchase,
it would not be very hard to strike a bargain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
So that, once finding form, character, fitness,
affection, desire to be mated, go about the rest
by a direct and sensible method, and don’t
wear out the gate-hinges, burn out all the oil,
weary the old folks, or turn gray with anxiety,
but do it.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a drunkard.</em> He will promise, by all
that’s good, great, and holy, to reform. How
many more like him have made just such
promises? He can’t keep such a promise if he
would. Make him reform a couple of years at
least, on trial, before you marry him. It will
be time enough then to risk a life-partnership,
to chain your hopes to an unfortunate creature
whose sense and judgment are corrupted, not
by will, perhaps, but by habit stronger than
reason. With most men this habit becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
desire. They are bound to feed the fire that
burns them. They have no voice in the matter,
and cannot, if they would, break the strong
fetters that bind them in irons, like the prison
bars confine their victims.</p>

<p>It’s a sorry picture to behold a fair young girl
chained to a being with a will all lost and debauched
in appetite for drink; a section of the
land of departed evil spirits can only equal her
daily misery. Children must bear it, friends
submit to it, and all of character, sweetness of
temper, or refinement in one’s nature will revolt
at the coarseness of the wrecked and
wretched career of a drunkard’s life. He is an
object of pity, and a being to be shunned in
matrimony, no matter how many promises he
makes or how good he is otherwise.</p>

<p>To avoid long sorrow, disgrace, and regret, avoid
him. If you had two lives and one to dispose
of, at any cost, mate with a drunkard and die a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thousand deaths. Your health, peace, and happiness
will go with his.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“Art thou mated with a clown,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Then the baseness of his nature</div>
<div class="indentbase">Will have weight to drag thee down.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such a man will kill his wife, burn his own
child, sacrifice everything on earth when
scourged by this degrading passion. More
could be urged, but let the starving families,
the criminal courts, the idiotic children, tell the
rest: the story is too dreadful to dwell upon.
It is monstrous. Life becomes a burden, and
death a sweet release from such a cross. Of
all the matches on earth, the most to be
dreaded and avoided is the drunkard’s wife.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a fast man or woman.</em> Something
tells us that black logs will darken the whitest
garments. The edge of virtue once dulled
is never quite so keen afterwards. It may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
very well to speak slightingly of wild oats,
but who cares to know that their oats are
a second crop? Who is willing to believe
that they are the last resort of one who has
pleaded and pledged to hundreds or even dozens
before her, or waits an opportunity to
make as many more pledges as occasion may
offer? Fast men are not satisfied with one
vice merely, but follow on to many. They
may drink, gamble, sport, and venture, and step
by step indulge in the kindred vices of lewdness,
till disease shall fasten its clutches in
their burning blood and run in their veins for a
lifetime. They are rarely satisfied with one
home, one wife, and one family.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a foreigner</em>,&mdash;one who comes from a
far-away country and returns to it. It is very
uncertain; think ahead carefully. The new
and strange customs of his country may and
may not be congenial. They may be a dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dream of home and early separation. Think
of the ties of friendship, the cords of affection
twined and woven around your nature; ties
that are not severed without many pangs of
sorrow. Life is a short, strange journey, and,
make it when we will or where we will, it is
pleasant to be made with company. Those
who know us best will love us most if we deserve
it, and few will continue on in friendship
long after we go to strange and unknown
countries. A stranger neighbor soon comes
nearer than a long-absent friend whom we
never hear from.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a spendthrift.</em> The habit of living
is formed early. Either one is bent on rising
or going lower. As water seeks its level, so
men seek their ambition and find it. Prosperity
comes not on silver trays, ready-made and
ready for use to everybody; most men work for
it, strive for it, and deserve it. The sons of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rich, who inherit property and have formed the
habit of useless spending, are a little bit lower
than the poor. It is not disgraceful at all to
be born poor; but to become so after once being
rich, and that through reckless spending,
is a dishonor to any one. “One thing we can
be proud of,” said Ingersoll; “we’ve made some
improvement on the original implements and
the common stock.”</p>

<p>A young man who lives on his father’s earnings
has very little to boast of, but one who squanders
his inheritance in riotous living is an object
of contempt and ridicule. “He is one of
the old man’s pensioners,” said a business man
lately of a rich man’s son. “But for his father’s
thrift he would be a beggar; he lives like
a refined beggar on the food furnished by another.
What a brilliant genius he is!”</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry your cousin.</em> It may be very tempting;
relatives are often warmly attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
each other from long and intimate acquaintance.
Remember that constantly thrown in
each other’s society will often create such attachments.
With many persons, marriage of
blood relations will more or less lead to deafness,
blindness, or deformity. It may skip one
generation and find another. It may result in
disease and weakness. It may be all right,
but seven to eight it is risky and uncertain,
and you can’t afford to be uncertain in such
matters.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry too far above or below you.</em> There is
no such thing as station in this country, like
the titles and surroundings of Europe; but
ignorance mated with refinement must be lost
and confused, and ill at ease every hour.</p>

<p>Such matches are hasty, and poorly considered.
They lead to gossip and resentment of relatives,
and an uncomfortable ill-feeling, seldom
cured for a full generation. If one has beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and refinement and is poor, never mind the
poverty; the good qualities are more than a
balance. But the marriage of a millionaire’s
daughter with a coachman is supreme folly. It
ends in disunion, and never in harmony. Water
and oil will as soon mix as such elements.
Avoid them.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a doubly divorced man or woman</em>: it’s
risky. Something is wrong surely. One divorce
should cure any one. Two is a profusion.
It may be that the doubly divorced is
innocent,&mdash;he will claim to be; but if he seeks a
new party to a possible divorce case (it will be
a habit by this time), tell him to wait a little
longer. Grass widows may be very lovable
creatures, but unless their other halves were
clearly blamable, beyond reasonable question,
give them a wide road and avoid them entirely.
It is a very bad sign, possibly a habit, that a
man and woman mate and divide soon after;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the fault may belong to either, and most likely
relates to both, in similar proportions.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a miser.</em> Of all the old “curmudgeons”
on earth, deliver me from crabbed, narrow-minded,
pinch-penny, miserable misers.</p>

<p>They begrudge you your meals and clothing.
They count your shillings and control your pin
purchases; they make life a burden, by owning
much and using little, and eternally twit you of
every quarter used ever so sparingly.</p>

<p>Life is made to live in and enjoy. We make only
one journey. We need not open up our purses
and leak out the pennies, just to see them roll
around promiscuously; but cutting notches on a
stick for each one of them, and never spending,
even for necessaries, without dread and grudging,
is intolerable. I had rather be poor and
enjoy something.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry too far apart in ages.</em> June and December
is a long, long distance in matrimony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Some people are as young-hearted at sixty as
others are at forty. Some men at forty-five
have hardly reached their manhood. But old,
white-headed men, marrying girls in their teens&mdash;servants
generally&mdash;are pitiable spectacles.
To the girl it is suicide; to the man sheer folly;
no need of marrying the man. The girl is the
most interested in this don’t sentence. Why
not, if you love him? This is the reason, not
jealousy,&mdash;that is a partial reason,&mdash;but consistency.
Think of a trip round the world or
across the continent with one older than your
father, to be called your husband, to be your
husband! It must be humiliating. It is annoying.
It is foolishly silly and inconsistent.
Money is a small compensation for such a sacrifice.
Love, and love only, should govern marriage,
and I doubt its sincerity when the difference
goes beyond reason.</p>

<p>Marry one whom you trust, admire, respect, look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
up to, and confide in, can be true to, and
one whom you love from good and earnest motives.
“Respect is a cold lunch in a dark dining-room.
Love is a picnic in the woods.”
Think of a picnic and an old man escort!</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry too old.</em> Be in earnest about it.
Here is the thought in a nut-shell:</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry odd sizes.</em> A tall man with a little
woman looks awkward enough; but a tall
woman with a little, tiny man is a misfit, surely.</p>

<p>See if you can’t find someone of your size, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
school-lads say in a wrestle. Pair off like
soldiers in time of dress parade, with an eye to
unity.</p>

<p>This caution relates to extremes, of course, and
not to small variances. Some change and grow
portly after marriage, but none get very much
taller after twenty-four.</p>

<p>Just for the looks of the thing, pair off in uniform
lines.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a man or woman without a character.</em>
Soon enough you’ll see the value of this caution.
Character is a matter that grows through a lifetime,
but enough of it crops out early to be
noticed. One is known not only by his company
but by his habits, his tastes, and his inclinations.
It is said that some whole families
are born fast; some thievish, some inclined to
crabbedness, others mild, upright, honest, and
reliable. It runs in the blood in some cases.</p>

<p>Suppose one is to marry for virtue, purity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
uprightness, he will seek it in the blood as much
as he would look for quality in a racer.</p>

<p>If a woman loves a rakish “man of the world,”
so called,&mdash;a name too often used to varnish a
bad character,&mdash;she will very easily find him
around the different bar-rooms of almost any
crowded hotel in the city or village. He will
be after marriage what he was before.</p>

<p>Tell me where a man goes, and I will tell you what
he is. If he is fast, he will cultivate fast habits,
live a rapid life, and earn that character very
early. If these are the traits you are looking
for, “inquire within” and you will find them. It
may be a woman you are asking about, a girl
for a wife, a life-long companion. Which are
you seeking for? A dashy, fly-away dancer,
or a domestic home-lover, and one whom you
can trust with your keys, your secrets, your
conscience? Look to her character. In either
case, the man or woman has lived somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Find out about it,&mdash;how long, how well, how
faithfully.</p>

<p>A well-to-do widow, was crazy to marry a man
that she fancied, and who actually refused to
give more than his name and hotel, and no
references. On careful inquiry such a person
was known by no less than two to four names,&mdash;changed
to suit circumstances. The spell
was broken, the match ended.</p>

<p>Men and women often rush into matrimony as
game is run into a trap, for the little tempting
bait set to catch them (a catch-as-catch-can
race). They marry and risk a life-long happiness
on less actual information of each other’s
real nature than a good horseman would exact
of his carriage horse’s pedigree. This may do
in the country, but never will answer in a city.
Sense and reason dictate that men and women,
to enjoy each other’s society, should see well to
the match beforehand. A fine hand, a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
foot, a becoming hat, a twist of the head, a
simper, or a half-witty saying will do well in
their places; but colors must <em>wash</em> and <em>wear</em> to
stand a lifetime.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a clown.</em> A silly fellow that jokes
on every subject never did amount to anything,
and never will. All he says may be very
funny, very; but how many times can he be
funny?</p>

<p>Fun will grow stale and threadbare; one cannot
live by it. Life is a trip that costs car fare, wash
bills, board bills, trinkets, notions, and actual
outlays. Real providers are never clowns; the
clownish fellow is a favorite in school-days. He
is so cute, just as cute as a cotton hat, so cunning,
so witty, so nice. Is he? Wait a few
years, until his nice nonsense turns to active
business!</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a dude.</em> Of all milk-and-water
specimens, a dude is the lowest,&mdash;a little removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from nothing; a dressed-up model for a
tailor-shop (sometimes it’s in woman form); a
street flirt, a hotel-step gazer, an eye-glass
ogler, a street strut; one who finds his enjoyment
in the looking-glass&mdash;a masher.</p>

<p>Very many are called, but few are chosen. The
many that are called are ridiculed. The time
will come when a tailor’s suit and a fancy outfit
will no more make one respectable than it
would make a gentleman of a wooden Indian
in front of a cigar-stand.</p>

<p>Men, real men of business, and men fit to marry,
are not dudes, but manly, upright beings, with
sense, integrity, and genius or industry; who
come upon the stage of life as real actors in its
affairs, not as “supes” and sham soldiers in
“Pinafore” battle-scenes, where a few parade
in fancy feathers as commodores for the amusement
of spectators.</p>

<p>Life is too earnest to spend on silly, tawdry, fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
colors or showy clothing; and the one who has
the less of it is the most likely to be marked for
a gentleman, and the brand will be correctly
designated. With women, no less than men, is
this silly street-walking habit quite prevalent.
A flirting woman on a public street is a sorry
picture; even one who stoops to notice her
must secretly know her measure. She deceives
no one, for her character, like the dude’s, is so
transparent that no one mistakes its meaning.
The habit of going nowhere for nothing is as
foolish as it is injurious.</p>

<p>Character grows out of little things. It may be
that being seen with a disreputable person three
times, or even once, will change the whole
current of our career. Don’t practise the vices
of dudes nor the habits of street flirts.</p>

<p><em>Do not marry a boy or girl who is not good at
home.</em> That is the golden test of duty,&mdash;to do
one’s duty alone, away from the eyes of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and the notice of the world; to be good from a
right disposition.</p>

<p>There is no safer rule to marry by than this: “She
loves her mother, and isn’t afraid to work. She
has a good name at home among her near
neighbors. She is neat, sweet, and tidy. Seven
days each week she is never off guard, always
a lady.”</p>

<p>And of a man may it be said, “He is a man, take
him all in all; he is manly, he is truthful; he
loves his home; he treats his sisters and mother
kindly. He is capable of good deeds, and incapable
of mean ones. He has a good name.”
He deserves success, and it will follow him. He
is plain, perhaps, but man outgrows it. He is
not a painting, an imitation, a counterfeit, but
simply a man. He will do to marry; so will
she, the last-named.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry from pity.</em> It may be akin to love,
but the kinship is quite distant. Many a weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
woman has so married, and only once regretted
it&mdash;each and every day afterwards. A life-long
regret must follow. What a cold respect is
that compliment to any woman, “I took pity
on her!” Away with such base uses of pity!
Many a woman has had pity on a rakish man
or a drunkard and married him to reform his
nature. Better, far better, trust a child with a
runaway horse or a mad dog. Danger seen
and not avoided is criminal carelessness. Surely
you can save one life, and its happiness, in such
cases. One is quite enough to be sacrificed.
Let bravery be shown by demanding a full
surrender and reasonable atonement.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry for an ideal marriage only.</em> The girlish
dream of marriage is so wide of the reality
as to be dangerous. She is to grow up and go
away, off to Italy, or some far-away clime of
sunshine; there to be taught music and the
classics. On some clear moonlight evening, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a summer-time, where birds sing all day long,
near a brook or flower-garden, she is to be surprised
by a creature of form and make and
mental endowment that shall thrill her whole
being into rapturous joy. They will go to the
parlor, and there, by a grand-piano, she will unseal
the pent-up currents of her heart, till tears
flow from all eyes around her; there she will
seem to hear the childhood melodies, the song
of departed friends, the harmony of all the
senses, mingling in one sweet welcome to her
new-found happiness.</p>

<p>Her prisoned soul is no longer grovelling in common
themes; all the latent power of her being is
to burst forth in gladness; and music of the
heart is to bear her up until the cottage walls
are narrow, till flowers and falling water, brilliant
company, ease and riches, smile upon her
glad career.</p>

<p>She is to be lifted up, and raised to heights before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
unknown to mortals. He of whom she
dreams of now is fit for Paradise. Finer and
finer every day will his genius grow, and nearer
to her liking every hour. There is just such
joy and just such glory in a new-born love, that
seems to reach a grander height each moment,
as on eagle’s wings.</p>

<p>And this is but the generous dream that Nature
gives, as a preface to a real life after,&mdash;so very,
very different. The girl that twines her tender
arms around her mother’s neck, and thrills with
joyous pride in telling of the brilliant prize
that’s offered her, thinks not of rainy days
ahead. Perhaps it is just as well; who would
begrudge her such half-hours of happiness?
But, seeing sometime she must break the spell
and know all, it may be safe to drop a hint in
season, and say, This way lies safety, that way
danger!</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a man of even doubtful character.</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
No matter how handsome or brilliant, a bad
man has in him elements that are always repulsive;
they are poison to his blood and his surroundings,
and the only safe guide is his character.</p>

<p>No matter how many promises of reformation;
you need not turn reformer for his sake. If
you will take the risk, do it after he proves
himself reformed, and be in no great haste
about it.</p>

<p>No amount of spicing and seasoning can make
tainted meat palatable, and no amount of
promising will reclaim a character tainted with
vicious habits once seated.</p>

<p>Young ladies who enter upon the reforming mission
furnish more women and children for
prisons, later in life, by their own misfortunes
than any one class. Cases of reclaimed men
after marriage are so rare as to be exceptional.
It’s always a dangerous experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Don’t marry too cautiously as to perfection.</em> It has
before been fully stated that men and women
are human, and imperfect. That is, if you are
hunting angels it’s a fool’s errand; there are
none unpledged. If you look for tall, handsome,
rich, manly, cultivated, talented, brilliant
men, or pure, refined, fascinating, beautiful
women, and one for each man the world over,
the supply never equals the demand of either
sex.</p>

<p>But to presume that the persons marked under
head of “don’t marry” cover all the rest is
unreasonable. There are thousands of noble
women and men, possessed of sterling sense,
strong bodies, affectionate natures, ability to
conduct a home, become a genial companion,
raise a family, shine in society, and bear their
full share of life’s earnest work. Occasionally
a man or woman will tower above their fellows,
but, generally, the real difference is less than is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
often supposed. The great majority are good,
and live and go to their reward unheard of outside
of their neighborhood.</p>

<p>One has put it rather strongly in this, to many:
“The lives of men and women, the best of
them, are marred and ruined by uncongenial
marriages. They mostly suffer in silence,
ashamed to complain of the chain they cannot
break. Men and woman cannot know what
their sweethearts will be after marriage. I have
known a sensitive man, a genius with a soul like
a star, whose life was a pilgrimage over burning
coals, because his wife was a coarse termagant.
Many a gifted woman, fit to be a queen or an
empress, is chained to a clod of a husband,
whose forced companionship is to her the tortures
of Inferno.”</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry expecting all the virtues in one person.</em>
If you do, the disappointment will be startling.
There are no perfect characters. History gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
none since the Saviour. Even Joseph was
willing to punish his enemies.</p>

<p>The majority of men and women are good and
pure and fair-looking. The numbers who go to
the bad are few compared to the good. Take
the country population, and ninety per cent
will be good; and sixty per cent of all cities are
people of fair characters.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that most people are bad
because the bad ones get so often chronicled in
public journals. The good, like the virtuous,
live and die and demand no praise of their
virtue. The great mass of men are sensible,
and honest and upright and sober, and worthy
to marry.</p>

<p><em>Don’t break a marriage abruptly.</em> This is the
wrong way to break a bad match. It intensifies
affection. It leads to elopement, or that
slow canker in a girl’s nature ending in melancholy,
or insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Love is a plant so tender that to uproot or transplant
it may touch a vital part. There are
ways enough to change its current; but of all
food to increase its growth, give it a little opposition.
Tell a child to leave something alone,
and he sulks to touch it. Tell a girl that the
man she admires is distasteful to her relatives,
and she half despises them from a simple motive
of resentment. Lead her by reason to see
with her own eyes, and she will be convinced.</p>

<p>The great London actor, Garrick, played the
drunkard to disenchant a girl, and succeeded.
Her parents might have tried it a lifetime and
failed. Human nature is queer. It will lead
when the way is enticing. It will magnify
discoveries, but they must be discovered in the
right manner. Remove not the prop till the
safety of the structure is secure without it.</p>

<p><em>Don’t oppose one’s marriage choice suddenly.</em> Should
a girl fall in love with one of bad character, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
best not to call him so at one breath; but say,
“What are his habits? Is he good enough
and worthy of so pure and comely a person as
you are?” Let this task be performed by some
girl of same age and class as the one you seek
to change. Let them be often together, and
find ways of expressing the objections by this
method&mdash;coming from a classmate, a friend, a
chum or companion&mdash;and your object may be
easily accomplished. A proposed absence without
showing why, a long journey with genial
company, may have the desired effect. At
least use one caution; see that the girl knows
the real habits and character of the man you
are opposed to her marrying. It will do more
than all the urging, scolding, coaxing, or threatening.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry for spite.</em> Why should you? If the
one whom you loved most has deceived you
and taken another, it will be folly to try to punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
him by hanging yourself, or committing a
double suicide in a loveless marriage.</p>

<p>You will learn this lesson all too dearly when it’s
over. Life is too short for those who love it
and are well mated; but many a miserable marriage
has made one or the other wish for death
a million times, to be rid of its burden.</p>

<p>You are the one most interested. You will find
out, after the knot is tied, that there are many
conditions in life better and easier to be endured
than a silly marriage to spite some one.
You will spite them better by showing what a
noble choice they had missed when they took
another in your place.</p>

<p><em>Don’t propose on a wash-day, in the rain, at
breakfast, or in a tunnel.</em> There is no room
for fainting in the former, and a narrow chance
for time in the latter.</p>

<p>Many ladies have singular notions on how proposals
should be accepted, and to such any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
rudeness is extremely shocking. A very modest
fellow, in deep anxiety, took up his fair
lady’s cat, and said, “Pussy, may I marry your
mistress?” when the young lady replied, “Say
yes, pussy, when he gets brave enough to ask
for her.” More than likely this brought the
young fellow to his senses. It certainly brought
matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>Most young people talk to each other as though
a tall stone wall stood between them and they
must find a door in it. Strange enough, the
difference in views vanishes at the merest mention
of each other’s sentiments.</p>

<p><em>Don’t mitten a mechanic</em>, simply on account of his
business. If he is worthy, never mind his business.
He can grow out of it, and will grow out
of it. Collier was a blacksmith, Wilson a shoemaker,
Andrew Johnson a tailor, Peter Cooper
a glue-maker, Grant a tanner, and Lincoln the
humblest of farmers. In this country it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a question what a man was, but what he is;
not even what he is, but what he may be, and
what he is capable of yet attaining.</p>

<p>Many a girl has turned away a mechanic and married
a rich loafer, only to find in good season
that the mechanic was at heart a gentleman,
with growing possibilities, and the loafer remained
such for all time.</p>

<p>Advice is seldom heeded in such matters, but it
may do to mention it. The true test of manhood
is seen in the mettle of boyhood. If you
wish to forecast the future, study the past history
of your subject. If one is selfish, tyrannical,
and overbearing by being rich, he will be
a bad man to marry. If, on the other hand, he
is pleasant, kind, genial, and forbearing, loves
his kind, is attentive to his mother and sisters,
and has made friends and character in early life,
he is not very likely to change his notions
later. There is often more manhood in a poor
one-armed man than a rich athlete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a man too poor.</em> It is the height of
folly to mate, and attempt to raise seven children
on what will bring up three indifferently.
Have a little discretion. Think that eating,
dressing, etc., cost something, and no one can
live happily without some of these common
comforts. If they cannot buy them single, it is
folly to double one’s misery by marrying in the
jaws of starvation. It is suicide: it is worse,&mdash;it
is double suicide, and may lead to pauperism
and crime and disgrace.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry where the woman is older than the
man.</em> Men are restless creatures and exacting.
They expect grace, beauty, and refinement;
they prefer youth to age, generally. At least it
is the fashion to marry a wife some years younger
than the husband. Women mature earlier;
they have less expectancy of long life, and on
an average live seven to ten years less, and show
age at fifty more than a man does at sixty-five.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Of the two, a woman should look smaller and
younger and better than a man. This accords
with the belief of all refined people.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a crank.</em> This class of men will be
wordy and persuasive. They tell all sorts of
stories of life,&mdash;how the world is mismade; how
they could improve upon this thing or that;
how marriages should be made between blondes
and brunettes; how, with their philosophy, society
would reach perfection.</p>

<p>Such men are invariably tyrannical. They are exacting
to the last degree; they have neither
faith, hope, nor charity, but run in one groove.
They distrust the powers that be, and generally
mount some hobby, and forever prattle about
the rights of free love or the wrongs of government.
Avoid them as you would a tramp.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry fine feathers.</em> Chesterfield was <em>well
up</em> on manners, and gave his son this rule,
among his twenty-one maxims to marry by:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
“Let not the rustling of silk entrap you into
matrimony.” Fine clothing has a certain fascination
to many. Some choose a wife by the
becoming effect of a tasty garment. Some
select a fine dancer; others rely upon a small
hand or a petite form. These points may be
all well noted, but they are but parts of a
greater whole that should govern a wise selection.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a “masher”&mdash;man or woman.</em> A
regular professional flirt will never settle down
to love one woman or one man. Habits once
formed will cling to them in after-life. They
are like runaway teams&mdash;liable to take fright
and go when least expected.</p>

<p>Civil attention, by a lady or gentleman, to the
other sex is natural and courteous, but the
thought that every fair lady is common prey is
repulsive. The traveller who avoids all vacant
car-seats but the nearest to a handsome young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
woman, and forces his conversation against her
will, has an eye to his business of one more conquest;
but the too often insulted woman who
complains of over-attention from gentlemen is
generally one who walks much unattended and
shows some willingness to be not wholly unnoticed.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry without love.</em> It will be plain enough
after a while. You will not mind it at first,
perhaps, but the time will come when, by a
song, or a face, or a voice, or a form, you will
awake as from a dream, to find you have
chosen carelessly. It will be too late then. A
loveless marriage may stand throughout a
honeymoon. It may last in youth, but not
when storms and trials <a id="Ref_54"></a>come in after-years.
It lacks that something which words do not
well express,&mdash;continuity, heart-bound devotion,
and endurance.</p>

<p>No matter how plain each or either may be, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
they love each other they will overlook little
things, and live patiently and happily to the
end. But once, at least, must come this joy and
glory of wedlock, that seems to be the wise
design of Nature,&mdash;a love for one another. It
endures through age and trouble, and is a more
lasting tie than all others together.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry an idle spendthrift</em>; one whose
money comes without effort at first, and goes as
rapidly, will one day come to want as certainly
as waters reach their level. Nature has fashioned
us all for work,&mdash;work of mind or work
of body, mental or physical labor,&mdash;and with it
comes strength of muscle and of will. Listless
life of idleness, without motive, without aim,
is open to every form of temptation.</p>

<p>It is not a crime to be rich, or to be poor. It is a
crime to be listless in a busy world. He would
be disgraced who, standing on a wharf, saw a
drowning crew without offering relief. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would be a coward who would not defend a
woman in distress; yet all around us are the
needy, helpless, drowning, starving, whom it is
our duty to rescue and lift up in life; and marriage
is the place where society is born, and
grows and ripens into use.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a stingy man</em>; of all narrow, mean
men, he is worst who has money, and has no
will to do good with it. A “dog-in-the-manger”
man, who can improve his town, his church, his
neighborhood, and does not, is a drone in life’s
hive and deserves no success.</p>

<p>One who is poor and has no means is excusable;
one who locks and buries treasures deserves
the Bible sentence of him who hid his talent in
the earth&mdash;to be taken from him and placed
with the active one’s talent.</p>

<p>A narrow, selfish, stingy man will count your pennies
spent, and postage used, and clothing
worn, as wasted. One must live in constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
dread of such a creature&mdash;we need not name
him man; it would disgrace the term. A
miser’s wife lives a loveless life.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry too hastily.</em> Some rush into matrimony
like a steam-engine going to put out a
fire, as though one moment lost would be
eternal defeat, and the first there gain the
highest prize. Many a one has repented more
leisurely and in sorrow for such conduct. But
of all things, marry at a good opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Don’t be too slow about it.</em> Girls who give up the
society of all but one, and turn their homes
into special receptions for one person, will be
worried to death in a year or two, if things
move too moderately.</p>

<p>Brace up and proceed to business, or release your
claim and let some one else have an opportunity.
Long engagements lead to lovers’ quarrels;
they, in turn, fail to make up sometimes,
and then follow scandal and gossip over broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ties; and later two go down to their early sleep
disheartened, ruined by a trifling neglect and
a reasonable inventory of prospects. You will
see it all plainly when it is over. It will be a
“might have been” then, sure enough, but too
late.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a silly girl.</em> It’s something of an art
to select a sensible person, but many are captivated
by frivolous sayings and coquettish acts
of simpering school-girls and marry them.
They make better playmates than wives. They
are generally shallow, nonsensical, and superficial.
They seldom learn anything; a tittering
girl is wearisome in real life. They are ever
unstable as water and changeable as wind; get
some one that you can rely upon in confidence.</p>

<p><em>Avoid slovenly dressed girls or heedless men.</em>
Life seems very short sometimes, but if ill-mated
it may be a long and tiresome life. A
woman with shoes run down, a man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
slouched and battered hat, reckless of neatness,
will grow worse, and seldom better.</p>

<p>Trifling as it may appear, the tidy dress, the tasty
every-day apparel, the ladylike appearance, and
general style of man or woman, go a long
way to form character. Beecher was right in
saying that “clothes do not make the man,
but they make him look better after he is
made.” The same rule is true of women.</p>

<p><em>Don’t expect too much in marriage.</em> The story
pen-pictures and fashion-plate models of men
that we see and read about are always exaggerated.
Not one man in a million would equal
their description. Men are plain flesh-and-blood
creatures; women are not angels. They
build their hopes too high who expect otherwise.
Take the handsomest person you know
and ten years’ wear will dull the edges; and of
all faded features, the once very handsome show
change the soonest. There are many little odd-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
fellows who grow up to be fine manly
men. The growth from boyhood or girlhood
to youth, and youth to manhood or womanhood,
and so on to old age, is marvellous. It takes a
keen sense of foresight to measure the future
of many boys and girls by their beginning.
There is no rule safer than choosing a good
form, a good brain, a good temper, and a good
character, and waiting for the other developments.</p>

<p>Endure what cannot be cured, and don’t wish
your wife or husband were as handsome as some
neighbor or as rich as some nabob. Youth and
good qualities are riches. It may be he is
richer by far than the very one envied. The
richest are not always those who own the most&mdash;many
of these are poor indeed, and often
miserable.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a fop.</em> Vanity in a woman is bad
enough, in men it is intolerable! A man-milliner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
a namby-pamby female male, a walking
model for ready-made furnishing-stores, may
think himself exceedingly stunning, but to a real
lady or gentleman he is a nonentity. Such
husbands never could be satisfied with the admiration
you would give them; they would
weary your mirrors and try your patience.
What are they good for, anyway? There is
room for women and room for men, but a half-woman
or a half-man is never great. They are
not very likely to marry at all, and less likely
to make home happy.</p>

<p><em>Don’t expect everything of one person.</em> Some expect
to marry love, beauty, talent, riches, and
affection all in one. It is unreasonable; you
will never find it, and may as well give up looking
in good season.</p>

<p>“Waukeen” Miller was requested to rewrite an
article sent to a New York magazine and returned
this pithy reply: “I can’t re-copy it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
can’t do everything. What do you expect of a
man, anyway&mdash;to be a genius, an inventor, and a
writing-teacher? No, I can’t bother my brains
with copying worth four to six hundred a year
at the highest.” This covers the whole subject
in a sentence. But it is well to add that Nature
is sparing of her gifts. To one she allots
beauty, to another strength, to another wisdom,
to a third courage, to a fourth ability to
acquire riches, to another that to write and
speak, to teach, to manage, to paint, or to control
armies: all are not alike, and to no one belong
all virtues.</p>

<p><em>Don’t expect too much of a wife.</em> If she is beautiful,
that will be her pride and ideal. If plain,
she may make it up a thousand times in goodness,
gentleness, industry, virtue (the plainest
are the least tempted). Earnest in her duty, she
may be of all women the most suited to your
station. If talented, she will devote herself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it. You cannot own beauty, talent, domestic
drudgery all in one.</p>

<p>“Looking for angels, are you?” said an advanced
maiden in the country. “Well, you’ll not find
’em fit for kitchen work; and, while I think of
it, how would you look by the side of an
angel, you brute you?” and he subsided.</p>

<p>No, they are not much suited to kitchen work,
the so-called angels; but many a mother who
has brought up a large family as her own
kitchen maid, without servants, who has braved
the hardships of poverty and privation, has
led a life but little lower than the angels, after
all.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry and cross your husband.</em> While on
this division, don’t cross your wife just at dinner-time.
After the cares of business he is
tired, fretful, and she is of similar humor. To
make a dispute is much easier than to make a
coal fire. Wait!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t flash up and speak back, and irritate by
quick answer. Wait!</p>

<p>If man or woman could only wait in seasons of
anger, all would blow over and harmony return
like spring flowers, that are not always in
blossom.</p>

<p>Don’t both speak at once, nor both get angry at
once, nor both be too determined at once. No
one is ever convinced by angry tones. It is
horribly repulsive to talk so; besides, you will
both be sorry for it very many times. Wait,
and let your judgment mature after dinner;
quarrel, if you must, in whispers; that is the
new fashion. Try the newer form.</p>

<p>About ten thousand new divorces could be prevented
each year by observing these rules of
common sense and reason. When will married
people and unmarried people, and lovers
and neighbors, learn how pleasant peace is, and
how awkward it is to quarrel together?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>One man pounds his finger with a tack-hammer
and blames his wife for <a id="Ref_65"></a>it a month later; one
man’s goose gets in a neighbor’s garden and is
killed&mdash;perhaps served him right&mdash;and yet they
are sworn enemies for five years later; and not
until some child is rescued from a burning
building or a mad dog, by the enemy neighbor
do the two know how pleasant and useful it is
to dwell in harmony.</p>

<p>Families who have been estranged for years are
some day&mdash;ah, some day!&mdash;called to look into
the sightless eyes that once flashed in anger, or
lay away in its earthy home the form they
shunned for some trifling answer in a passion.
If we knew how soon, how cautious we would
be! Life is so short to quarrel and make up
in; they who quarrel may never make up.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry in fun.</em> Be in earnest about a matter
of so much moment. It may seem funny
to a lot of girls out on a sleigh-ride to call in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
some one and wind up an escapade by a double
wedding; but few of such marriages ever end
well.</p>

<p>Sudden and ill-considered matches are mismatches.
You may have a mother, a sister, or
a family to consult; then the old-fashioned
way is the best. It’s a left-handed marriage at
best that will not allow the forms used for ages
to strengthen its solemnity.</p>

<p>Let the world know by open dealing that you
have married above any secrecy, elopement, or
underhanded fashion. Be brave enough to
follow the form of society in a manner that
concerns every neighbor and every relative.</p>

<p>Marry at home or at church, in good form, without
display; marry according to the best usage
of the best people, and you will reap some
benefit from the sensible conclusion.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry without an eye to comfort.</em> A man
that expects to live thirty years or more with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a partner will investigate his likes and dislikes;
so should a woman. Are you ready to attend
a cattle ranch and brave the frontier? Then
look the matter clearly in the face at the first
hint of the man’s proposal who expects it.</p>

<p>Do you prefer the city to the country? Look
to the earliest opportunity. Can you endure a
soldier’s absence, or wait for an explorer? or
will you prefer a domestic relation that brings
you both under one roof daily? These questions
should be answered soon enough to prevent
regret, remorse, or separation. The greatest
of all dangers in marriage is the color-blindness
of lovers: they never use but one color&mdash;rose
color&mdash;till a few weeks after the wedding.</p>

<p><em>Don’t spurn a man for his poverty.</em> “Prosperity is
the parent of friends; misfortune is the fire by
which they are tried.” One may be poor by an
honest failure, another may be rich on ill-gotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
gains. The first the lord of honor, the
last a prosperous knave.</p>

<p>“I would give it all willingly and work by the
day if we could be placed back where we were,
and be free from the worry and dread and
anxiety,” said a rich man’s wife to a waiting
friend by her sick bedside.</p>

<p>Who does not know of poor, plain boys who endured
the poverty of youth, struggled with
their studies, carved out a fortune as from
flinty marble, and enjoyed it in maturer years,
all the more for the effort it cost them, all the
more likely to last and continue to bless other
generations?</p>

<p>Franklin commenced poor with a penny loaf;
Greeley was homely and awkward. Few would
have looked for Lincoln’s rise. Giddings and
Collier and Garfield all started low on the
ladder, and ended high in honor and worthy of
any woman’s affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>If we could only get near enough to Genius to
comprehend its superior worth; if we could
reverence talent and admire integrity and take
true measure of prospective greatness, what
a fortune we would possess!</p>

<p>Like high-priced lots in large cities, the discoverers
of rare locations seldom knew the value of
their purchases. It takes time for development;
more time in genius and character than
we are always ready to wait for; but the far-seeing
are always rewarded, so with the prizes
of matrimony.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry and expect a husband to be wealthy
while young.</em> Only the older men should be
looked to for high financial standing. In a
hopeful country like ours, few are rich under
fifty, seldom under sixty.</p>

<p>Young men who earn their education, and begin
and learn a business are barely partners at thirty
or thirty-five. It takes time to prosper. Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
mistakes may be made. Scarcely a wholesale
house in New York or Boston has run on
twenty years without a failure. Failure is the
rule, success the exception. Patience, pluck,
and perseverance win the victory, but they
who spend freely in the forenoon have little
left in the evening. Those who save early
double in like ratio later on.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry in opposite religious views.</em> If possible,
marry near your own belief. This may
seem strained, but the story of divorces will
confirm its wisdom. Children and parents very
often disagree on religious subjects. The
farmer’s “Betsey and I are out” controversy,
“was a difference in our creed. And the
more we argued the matter, the less we ever
agreed.”</p>

<p>It is pleasant to agree on a subject so vital in
families, more especially so in Protestant and
Catholic families, where education is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
controlled by church government, and
marriages are held illegal in one church if not
solemnized by its forms and between regular
believers in its faith and doctrines.</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry a duke</em>, or any man who travels on
his title. The most of such men are very common,
and the most of young people who seek
their company are sold, deceived, and seriously
disappointed.</p>

<p>They expect a fortune to begin with, and will be
the most exacting of all mortals. This is a mere
matter of birth and surroundings. Novels tell
many beautiful stories (pretty visions) about
brave and noble dukes and their princely
palaces, attentive servants, and flower-arbors.
Experience tells far different stories.</p>

<p>The history of nine out of ten of such unnatural
unions is a record of a half million or so
squandered on a petted daughter to satisfy a
mother’s ambition, and ending in misery entailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
by the dearly bought purchase. Don’t
marry so much out of rank as to be a burden,
or carry a burden.</p>

<p><em>Do marry a man that you can look up to</em>, and see
that he can do likewise. There are plenty of
farmers, mechanics, merchants, conductors, doctors,
lawyers, and men of general business, who
are worthy, trusty, generous, noble, and will
make excellent husbands.</p>

<p>Seek them out from their character, their conduct
at home, their treatment of sisters and
mothers, their devotion to business and adherence
to principle. Show them that you
trust them. Be ready to marry. Become accomplished
and useful. Make yourself worthy
of a home, and know how to manage it with
skill and kindness. Loving natures are not
long neglected. The worn-out belles and women
who fade and wither, and die snappish and
single, were insincere, or lacked some quality
of winning manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Do marry a President.</em> That is the correct form
now. It’s so romantic. Waive all the hints of
other objections,&mdash;age, love, spite, money, and
the like. Get a President,&mdash;just for the position,
you know!</p>

<p>Then all the little jewels and diamonds and presents
will come rolling in like flowers to a favorite
singer. All little objections vanish in the
presence of a President. He must be suited to
any condition of beauty, genius, or intellect.
Don’t refuse a President’s offer; you may never
get but one such in a lifetime.</p>

<p><em>Do marry a plain man.</em> Just a plain, common-sense
man; be he banker, lawyer, doctor, farmer,
builder, merchant, so he is a man; for manhood
is at a premium to-day in home life! The
world is full to overflowing with brilliant men.
Public offices are public trusts, and all that such
responsibility implies, and there are women in
stations where the word home has very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
meaning, and other women who long for the
quiet and comfort of true domestic life away
from the cares of office and the demands of
lofty stations.</p>

<p>Two of the things that lead to greatest misery of
the masses to-day are over-ambition and reckless
marriages.</p>

<p><em>Don’t coax a woman to love you.</em> If you wish to
win, that is certainly the wrong way. If they
have any notion of it, you are in the opposite
direction of success.</p>

<p>Women despise a fawning, cringing nature. “Fortune
and women, born to be controlled, stoop
to the forward and the bold.”</p>

<p>A far more sensible way to win will be by indifference.
Show enough willingness to reassure
her, and enough courage to act
manly.</p>

<p>Ten to one you have mistaken her temper by
lack of frankness. Nothing is more touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
than truth. If you are really bent on marrying
and have told the right person the whole
story, earnestly and truthfully, the answer
should be decisive.</p>

<p>Keen dealers seldom banter; they may hesitate,
they may explain their wants and wishes, they
never parley very long or express much anxiety
to strike a bargain.</p>

<p><em>Winning a wife or a lover is a rare art.</em> To be
worthy of either is the first essential. It is
better to be worthy of it than to be President
and unworthy.</p>

<p>It must be consoling even to a jilted lover to feel
that he is superior to the one successful. The
next thing to being worthy is being ready.
Many a youth begins driving, sleighing, and
dressing for society who pays his clothing bills
by instalments, and whose salary is wholly
unequal to his outlay.</p>

<p>Fairness demands that a girl in marrying should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
better her condition. How can one expect
her to marry into misery?</p>

<p>Chesterfield quotes an old Spanish saying of great
force and aptness: “It is the beginning that
costs in everything. The first step over, the
rest is easy.”</p>

<p><em>Don’t marry recklessly.</em> Before two or more men
form a partnership, they learn each other’s
means of furthering the business to be engaged
in; the confidence that each is worthy of, the
skill, attention, etc., each can give, and the
prospects of a mutual agreement and prosperity.</p>

<p>Without some inquiry on these vital requisites, no
company concern would be founded. It would
be a foolish investment to purchase goods and
fit up stores or warehouses without some forecast
of results; and yet this is precisely in the
line of marriage.</p>

<p>Partnerships are business marriages. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
best to be too cool and calculating about it;
one caution may let another take the venture
and draw the premium. But some common-sense
may as well be mixed with a matter so
vital as a life-long engagement.</p>

<p>Firms are limited to a few years; marriages are
unlimited save by death, or divorce, for over a
third of a century, on an average. While it is
very difficult to tell whom to marry,&mdash;for no
one can foresee your circumstances,&mdash;still, it is
well to mention a large class that no one should
marry, at least till all others are no longer accessible.</p>

<p>If one could foresee the extent of happiness depending
on this selection of partners, if he
would take a simple business caution and investigate
enough to be considerate, he might
save society from disgrace and himself from
lasting misery. For the fact is, that the
most glaring of all our American evils is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
looseness of marriage ties, and the misery it
entails on domestic relations.</p>

<p>If these hints or reminders should induce one
woman to avoid a bad marriage, and one man
to contract a good one, or save a long quarrel,
or keep families in harmony, or help some poor
bashful fellow to gain his Yes by a sensible
proposal, the time in reading will be well spent,
the trifling cost will be a splendid investment.</p>

<h2>ROMANTIC MARRIAGES.</h2>


<p>Caroline Crofton had completed her course at
Vassar, one of its earliest graduates, and one of
the most brilliant in her class of thirty odd
young New England, graceful, gifted, and
generous girls, that have long been noted for
their purity of principles and perfection of
character. She was smaller than her classmates,
an only daughter of Judge Crofton,
whose manner and training marked him as a
classical, refined, and upright gentleman, and a
dignified and just judge.</p>

<p>All that culture could impart, or character add to
the graces of nature, was bestowed upon Caroline,
who never assumed the fashion of shortening
her name by fancy contractions. Carline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
was the shortest way of calling her, and this
was not a favorite with her mother. From her
father she inherited the qualities ascribed to
her, while her mother, like a clinging vine wound
around the oak, was of a trusting, lovable, nature,
of darker hair and eyes than the Judge;
and the two mingled in the daughter, and
formed a slender figure and a graceful form, an
ardent, lovable character, as one could easily
discover.</p>

<p>Diligent by nature and proud of her progress in
early studies, Caroline had entered Vassar’s advanced
classes and employed all her energy to
excel in each department.</p>

<p>She literally lived in her books for four full years,
to the exclusion of modes, society, or even the
newspapers; her one ambition seemed ever to
be excellence, and when the graduating day arrived,
and the long row in white were seated in
breathless awe to read their papers and receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
their reward, something more than a common
interest was awakened.</p>

<p>Such are the days when young men of wealth and
ambition, and poorer men with an eye to the
beautiful, come in and listen to the overdrawn
pictures of school-girls’ first productions.</p>

<p>The theme of Caroline Crofton was “Pioneers;”
how they had founded our government in the
little log school-houses of New England, in the
sixteenth century; how they had established
their town meetings and voting precincts; how
they had gradually driven back the Indians
(“noble redmen”) from the rich, fertile valley
of the Mohawk in New York, cleared away the
underbrush from the fertile plains of Northern
Ohio and Pennsylvania, and boldly evaded
the massive pineries of bleak, cold Northern
Michigan; dauntlessly, fearlessly, and bravely
establishing schools and churches in the very
midst of Indian huts and wigwams, taking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
lives in their hands, to improve and populate a
great and growing nation; and how wonderfully
they had all prospered.</p>

<p>In her vivid and graphic picture of a fruitful
theme (a theme learned from books and stories),
she dwelt on the part that mothers had borne,
and brothers were bearing, in this tide of prosperity
and improvement, till tear-drops came
fast to the earnest eyes of the old gray-haired
professors, who were judges, and many a
mother’s heart leaped with joyous pride at
the mention of brave sons battling with the
Western wilderness, for their sons were among
them.</p>

<p>Caroline Crofton could feel the hush of silence,
always such applause as is irresistible; she could
feel the emotion, and conveyed that emotion to
her audience; she forgot herself, forgot her
hearers, and read with a girlish animation born
of deep-seated belief in the grandeur of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
theme she advocated. Round after round of
applause greeted her conclusion, and she staggered
to her seat literally overcome by the
brilliant effort which resulted in a handsomely
inscribed medal as first of her class of Vassar.</p>

<p>Whether the influence of that essay on the mind
of Caroline, or its greater influence on Cyrus
Arthur (a newly arrived resident of Vassar) was
the most potent means of a quick acquaintance
between them, is not well known to the writers;
certain it is that an early friendship soon refined
into affection, and meagre inquiries into his
character being satisfactory to Caroline, he was
promptly admitted as a suitor at the dignified
household of Judge Crofton, on the banks of
the beautiful St. Lawrence. The Judge was led
to believe that a long acquaintance had ripened
between schoolmates, when in fact it was a love
at first sight affair, and on very little consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>That these young and ambitious lovers enjoyed
all that is allotted to their class is forever a secret,
for their after-life reveals but little of its mystery.
Their after-life was a struggle for bread
first, and position soon after. They really put
off living, very foolishly.</p>

<p>Cyrus Arthur was a large, strongly built, dark-haired,
handsome fellow, of considerable assurance
in the social gatherings, and generally
managed to lead off with the dances and parties
from his size and commanding way more than
from any merit of talent or real goodness in
himself; one of the village leaders who gained
favor by fine looks and outward appearance;
one of the petted class of forenoon brilliants
whose afternoons are often more shaded.</p>

<p>There was a smile of serene contentment and half-satisfaction
on the haughty face of young
Arthur as he offered himself to the Judge’s
daughter in that manner assumed by generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in battle. He obtained his prize, and she obtained
her ambition. He married beauty, she
married a leader. Her highly colored future
was a life of intellectual greatness; his first
pride was of conquest, then of distinction.</p>

<p>A large man in a small place may be a little man
in a large city.</p>

<p>In good season they were married, of course; and
of their courtship little need be said, for it was
all unromantic.</p>

<p>Arthur’s father was a merchant of limited means,
and the younger having high notions of going
West to grow up with the country, early
settled in a lumber-making city of North Michigan,
where he took his fair young companion,
who soon realized that her rose-colored romance
of brave pioneers was not a living reality.</p>

<p>Dreams are one thing, real life is another; work
was scarce in the big overgrown city, but plentiful
in the pineries; and after the first day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
married life wore into weeks, and living expense
came around with painful regularity, the new
couple were forced to economize, then look for
employment, which they first found in tending
store and camp, cooking for a large lumber-ranch;
certainly far less refining than the vision
of a Vassar schoolgirl’s essay had pictured.</p>

<p>But they prospered, and by dint of close saving,
always coming from the wise counsel of the
weaker one, they became managers, then
owners, of a portable saw-mill and a ranch, and
gradually a store building partly paid for.</p>

<p>From the letters home, showing their thrift and
economy, gradually came small sums lent to the
far-away idol of the staid old Judge’s household.
Cyrus was surprised and delighted one day to
find a large bill of goods sent on to fill up their
store and give them a start in their hard beginning.</p>

<p>It was the work and influence of that little brainy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wife, whose tender hands had grown harder by
cooking, mending, and working for forty or
more robust workmen, and the reward it
brought and the encouragement to both. With
a well-stocked grocery and comfortable surroundings,
Cyrus began to look the world in the face
quite complacently, and take matters easier.
Meanwhile, the silent ambition of Caroline determined,
if growing up with the country meant
anything, she would fathom its mystery, and she
continued to delve and save, and plan and execute,
and encourage her husband in his extensive
contracts.</p>

<p>Here was a profit on forty laborers, a margin on
their payment in goods, a rise in lumber, and a
golden opportunity to buy vast tracts of pine
timber at very low figures in cash payments.
Drawing on her savings the little wife advised
wise investments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Fifty-seven, eight, and nine were the three trying
years in Northern Michigan. Many a man
would cheerfully trade a load of shingles for a
bag of corn, and a thousand feet of timber for
a single ham. New England thrift was in the
market, and the little daughter of a discreet
judge balanced the chances and made hay in
sunshine most effectually.</p>

<p>Four years passed by, and a rapid rise in prices
gradually increased the value of timber, then
lumber, then shingles, then lands, and long
before the war ended, Arthur and his once
timid wife were among the wealthy citizens of
the Rapids.</p>

<p>A large, strong frame, and but little anxiety; a
dark, swarthy complexion, with a heavy black
beard; the face of such a man at thirty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
showed less signs of wear than his little fair-faced
companion at six years younger.</p>

<p>Age, climate, work, and care were telling on the
slender build of Caroline. The rapid birth of
three children in ten years told also their story
of a mother’s anxiety, written in shading lines
on her once delicate features.</p>

<p>Absorbed in her duties as a wife, she had little
room for society, while he, a man relieved by
riches from hard labor, was approaching that
prime of maturity when the world looks complacently
upward to one who has prospered,
not even asking how, or why, or any reason.</p>

<p>Long trips to large cities, absence from home,
mingling often with wealthy lumbermen, and
assuming that position that wealth ever commands
in society, were doing for Cyrus Arthur
what they will do for many in like situations.</p>

<p>He craved a larger field for usefulness, he moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and settled in a large city; he craved society,
he was a favorite with women; he developed a
fondness for the more forward class. He fell;
he fell often.</p>

<p>If he had ever loved his devoted wife, the author
of all his success and prosperity, he now grew
unloving, haunted by the caresses of more passionate
women. Driven by appetite to seek the
companionship of the brazen and deceitful, he
lost his self-respect, his love of home, and grew
madly in love with a most bewitching character,
lately divorced from her husband.</p>

<p>A spell came over him; “the trail of the serpent
is over them all,”&mdash;the “twelfth temptation,”
as shown in the powerful drama of its name, that
takes a farmer-boy in innocence, carries him
safely through the perils of a great city, saves
him from saloons and wine, and larceny and
dishonesty, and at last when weakened by tampering
with sin, brings him face to face with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
such dazzling beauty that his fall before it
seems as natural as his ruin later is effectual.</p>

<p>The trail of the serpent had crossed by the path
of Arthur. The coil wound around him, for
he loved the bold siren who enchanted him,
and yielded to the twelfth temptation.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>“For a woman can do with a man what she will;”
yet a man who knows a woman thoroughly
and loves her truly&mdash;and there are women who
may be so known and loved&mdash;will find, after a
few years, that his relish for the grosser pleasures
is lessened, and that he has grown into a
fondness for the intellectual and refined amusements
without an effort, and almost unawares.</p>

<p>Fettered and controlled by the witchery of his
evil genius, Cyrus Arthur lost all power but
that borrowed of his seducer. Her counsel replaced
the once wise confidence of a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
companion. Her influence was as a loadstone
in a compass,&mdash;it carried him in dumb obedience
to her will. He was absorbed, confused,
bewitched, stranded, lost!</p>

<p>As often as they met in their evil way, she demanded
a divorce and insisted on early proceedings.</p>

<p>“But the cause?” he would say. “Cause?” she
would answer; “make a cause!” “Not so easily
done,” replied her willing admirer.</p>

<p>“Money will do anything,” was her ready answer.</p>

<p>“Money will do anything,” repeated the fond
lumberman; “true, money will do everything.”</p>

<p>But how? When, and where?</p>

<p>These questions were all puzzling.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>There was a dark-faced inspector, a man-of-all-work
in lumber camp, called Roland, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
often called at Arthur’s, and who occasionally
partook a little too freely of Northern fire-water,
as the Indians term it, and whose poverty at
such times would consent to almost anything,
on one pretence and another.</p>

<p>Young Roland was sent to inquire if Mr. Arthur
was in, or if Mrs. Arthur needed shopping
done, or errands attended to, with instructions
to hint that his employer was seen riding out
with the enchantress in a cutter, seemingly on
the way to another village. These little irritations
were to be repeated for effect, but no
effect seems probable. They did create some
inquiry, and at such dates of confidential conferences
Mrs. Arthur was alone with the hireling
spy and listened to his inferences of her
husband’s indiscretions.</p>

<p>Neither by word nor deed nor murmur did Caroline
exhibit a sign or symbol of her unhappiness,
save by the deeper lines and paler countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that easily escaped detection to one who
barely looked her in the eyes twice a day for
months together.</p>

<p>It was a failure; she would never act, he must
take the initiative.</p>

<p>Armed with a sworn affidavit of her infidelity
with Roland on a recent occasion, together
with further papers to complete their separation
and settle an alimony of a few thousand
dollars as her share of their large property,
Cyrus Arthur visited his wife late at night as a
robber would call for her jewels, and demanded
a complete surrender. Stunned and shocked,
and overcome by the intelligence, she wept
most bitterly, pleaded, begged, and implored
her husband, in the name of Heaven, to spare
her and her <em>children</em> from a disgrace so terrible.
The sighing of the pines in a Northern
forest would have moved him as soon from his
purpose. She was between him and an envied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
object; he must succeed. He was already
goaded to desperation. Seizing the part of
her plea relating to her little girls, he made the
worst of it.</p>

<p>“If you would spare yourself and them from disgrace
eternally, make no denial and all shall be
secret, and no one the wiser.”</p>

<p>“Can this be true?” asked the distracted mother
of the other’s lawyer.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, cases have been heard on default
and divorces granted, and not one scrap
of bill or answer ever published.</p>

<p>“What is a bill and answer?” questioned the little
woman in her tears, for she never dreamed
of a divorce between her and her husband till
that moment.</p>

<p>“It is the ground and denial for divorce,” replied
the attorney.</p>

<p>“Cyrus Arthur,” said his wife, as she looked at
the eyes that evaded her earnestness, “do you
mean this proceeding, or are you trifling?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am in earnest,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten my home, my surroundings,
the shock to my mother, my father, my own
feelings, my neighbors, our children? Do you
realize how you sin, and wrong me?</p>

<p>“How I have toiled and helped you, planned our
success! How I have suffered, gone almost in
the grave, in bringing you these children! Are
you in earnest?</p>

<p>“If your heart is not iron, speak to me; shall I
deny such a foolish slander? Shall I tell you
before God, who will one day judge us all, that
every one of the charges are infamous lies and
perjuries; shall I place my word against his
and you deny me?”</p>

<p>“But you cannot swear in court in such cases,”
said the ready lawyer.</p>

<p>“Then Heaven will hear me; I am innocent.
And may the Almighty end my life right here,
if I have ever, by act or look, or word or deed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
done aught that a true woman should not do
in every day of our married life, from first to
last, as God is my witness!”</p>

<p>“But your children?” he pleaded, as if he had
heard not a word of her earnest protest.</p>

<p>On and on they argued, later and later grew the
hour, till, worn out at midnight they passed her
the papers, and eight thousand dollars, with
which she was to return to her home in New
England, and abandon all defense to the proceeding,
including a release of all dower interest
in his estate, real and personal.</p>

<p>You may smile at the absurdity, you may question
the reason of such haste and compulsion.</p>

<p>“But who, alas! can love and still be wise?”</p>

<p>Ask of the court records in every American city,
and you will find stronger cases and stronger
instances, more degradation, greater hardship,
and equal perjury. Ask of <em>one</em> court and find
this case!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>No sleep nor rest comes to Caroline Arthur.
Early dawn found her surrounded by her weeping
children, in alarm at the sudden illness, for
she only called it illness.</p>

<p>Twice she started for the City National Bank to
deposit her money, and twice relented. Once
she determined to consult a neighbor, and later
concluded she would bear alone her sorrow.</p>

<p>Hastily filing his bill and securing her appearance,
an early demand for a hearing before a
commissioner, in less than a <em>single week</em> came
a divorce on the ground of infidelity.</p>

<p>Elated by his victory, with his deeds well recorded,
and the court’s great seal granting their
divorcement, Cyrus Arthur stalked the streets
in supreme confidence as a man of victory.</p>

<p>It is said that Roman generals, once victorious
ever bore about with them the marks of conquerors;
so did our modern general, but for a
brief duration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Once in the newspapers, and the busy streets
were vocal with open denunciation. “Eight
thousand dollars from a property worth one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars!” came from
bankers. “The wife that made him what he
is,” said another. “A shame to our civilization,”
said the third. “A fraud, a sham, a pretext,”
said another.</p>

<p>And the majority joined in the last anthem,&mdash;“a
sham, a pretext,” a trick to turn off his
worn-out wife and marry that impious trader in
unvirtue and immorality.</p>

<p>Press interviews were had, and the dear little
lady of clean hands and honest heart, whose
soul shone as a diamond in the filth of foul
slander around her, utterly and consistently refuted
and denied the whole story, and related
its history with marvellous circumstantial evidence
to convince any reasonable person of her
truthfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Indignation knew no bounds; a firm of able lawyers
at once filed a cross bill, and a prayer to
set aside the fraudulent bill and another to
annul all conveyances to Arthur; and within
almost as brief a limit as he had secured his
decree she had been restored to her rights with
a divorce from Arthur and a thirty-thousand-dollar
settlement.</p>

<p>He was driven from the city in infamy, and she
lived on in honor; but the stain on the children
was of a nature more permanent.</p>

<h2>UNROMANTIC MARRIAGES.</h2>


<p>Grace Hartwell graduated at Hillsdale College in
18&mdash;, and settled as an assistant teacher in the
Union school on College Hill, living with her
mother across the narrow river near by, where
she would pass the old homestead of Richard
Baker, son of a well-to-do farmer adjoining the
village, and who early became interested in the
fair young teacher.</p>

<p>Grace was a full brunette, of fairer complexion
than is common to her school of beauty.</p>

<p>She was beautiful, with well rounded arms, heavy
black hair, rosy lips, white hands, eyes of
marked expression&mdash;eyes that stood out full,
and shone in striking contrasts, the black portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and the white being clear and sharply
defined.</p>

<p>Grace was no less a beauty than a dreamer, and
longed for the kind of change that best suits a
girl of her quick, passionate, and impulsive
nature&mdash;a marriage.</p>

<p>Richard was below the medium size, with very
light hair, of slim figure, reticent of speech, shy
and bashful, especially so in the presence of
Grace, whom he met at parties, donations, and
college receptions, so frequent and amusing in
their lively village.</p>

<p>Both went too long a distance for their dinner to
make the trip agreeable, and both often carried
their daily lunches in little baskets for convenience.</p>

<p>On their homeward trips they met occasionally,
bowed, passed the time of day, chatted of the
last night’s party. It was growing so much of
a custom with Richard to meet these road-side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
appointments, self-made, and well timed to
match his lonely companion, that they soon became
a matter of each day’s history.</p>

<p>Grace was willing to listen, Richard was anxious
to turn aside from his regular pathway and go
round a square to bear her company.</p>

<p>They were in love without romance, and against
both the belief and expectation of all their associates.</p>

<p>She was the prize of the village; he was neither
well-off nor popular, but plain and unhandsome.
He was not her only suitor, but the first had
taken some pique at her attentions to a stranger
in the village, that offended the haughty admirer
of her beauty, and each was claimant for her
entire devotion.</p>

<p>Miss Hartwell’s father was a tall black-eyed Virginian,
warm-blooded, swarthy, and impulsive,
and liked not the manner of his daughter’s new
friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>He put his foot down with emphasis. He insisted
on obedience. He wanted position, old family,
wealth and social standing, or no marriage.</p>

<p>Grace could not always govern her scholars, but
herself she was determined to control.</p>

<p>Herein both father and daughter were much alike.</p>

<p>Time passed; attachment increased by opposition.
Such is more often the way of lovers separated;
but these were not wholly separated.</p>

<p>At the death of Richard’s stepfather a division of
the estate netted a round three thousand to the
young farmer, who had done nearly all the farm
work lately, and now started on an early Northwestern
visit to the wheat-growing regions, resolved
on a test of climate, comparison of prices,
and general outlook for an investment. He
bought early and largely in prairie lands of finest
quality. He struggled, prospered, and grew
well-to-do as a farmer.</p>

<p>And what became of Grace, the teacher? Letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to and from Dakota, neatly written,
choicely worded, and carefully punctuated, from
one side; hurried notes, badly composed, from
the other. The mind is never quite full of two
subjects at once, and the surest cure for heartache
is active employment and earnest work.</p>

<p>The increasing cares of farming, the magnitude of
the business, the constant desire for money
(for the seed-time of farming is in its early
stages), were a source of daily anxiety to Richard.
“My poor Richard” was not a common
name for a heading to Grace’s letters; truly she
had found a fit name for her absent lover; a
lover of land and of cattle, a lover of acres and
of reapers, a lover of fences and shade-trees,
and a growing Northwesterner; but poor, indeed,
in actual happiness.</p>

<p>They were married; Grace removed to her rude
quarters and furnished them by taste, skill,
and refinement. She took to her new home all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the delicacy of rare machine-work, neat stitching,
and tidy ornaments of her Eastern education;
the sewing of many odd hours of industry.</p>

<p>It seemed like an endless harvest, a long busy day,
a strife and a struggle, in a wilderness of bleak
broad fields at great distance from market.
They raised vast crops, but sold at low prices.</p>

<p>The panic of ’73, and the cold winter following,
made not a very happy honeymoon to both,
but they endured it all, risked all in a fond
large hope of abundant future riches. In a
land of no railroads (it’s changed now; it’s as
much more brilliant to-day as an electric light
compared with the light of a common candle),
Dakota was then rather a dreary country.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is true, there would come over
Grace a feeling of lonesome homesickness. It
comes to a far-away settler many times in a
lifetime; but she would choke it under, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
resolve to be a brave wife and a worthy companion.</p>

<p>Ten years have rolled by, and times are better;
both are older, worn a little by climate, larger,
changed.</p>

<p>On the way to the National Park I chanced past
their village one evening on the great Pacific
Railroad, and mentioned “Hillsdale” incidentally.</p>

<p>I saw a woman turn half-way round and look
towards me, but went on unmindful of the situation.
Suddenly her companion arose and
asked me if I said Hillsdale, to which I assented,
and then a vacant seat was made and both
came back and questioned me. They were
strange people, truly.</p>

<p>He a stout-built, long-bearded man, half gray,
with buffalo overcoat, fur cap and mittens on;
she well wrapped in beaver; both Western-looking
in every particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“You spoke of Hillsdale, sir,” began the woman;
“and we lived there once, and feel curious to
know if you would not remain all night with
us. We have a farm near by next station.
I hope you will consent to spend the night
with us;” clearly the woman was the social
leader.</p>

<p>There was a pleading in the look, a frank expression
that said, Please do, and I consented.</p>

<p>Two miles, a drive by a cold open sleigh-ride&mdash;cold
is hardly strong enough to mark the term,&mdash;and
we found a low unpainted farm-house, plastered
below, with chamber-floor for ceiling overhead,
and rudely formed walls; a house of three
rooms, mainly in two; a farm of six thousand
acres, five teams, three tenant-houses, wagons
and sleighs and farming-tools without stint, but
comfort nowhere.</p>

<p>After breakfast the farmer fed his flocks and attended
to his general chores, while I stayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and chatted by a sickly pretence of fire made
of bad coal and green kindling-wood. I had
seen, each time as he came in, how gently he
handled his little pet dogs, that seemed their
only children, how deeply absorbed he was in
farm and stock, and how anxious he was I
should see the ranch, but how little he noticed
his superior companion.</p>

<p>“Where are your children?” I ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>“They are all three yonder in the field,” she said,
and I knew they all slept in narrow houses
there. This seemed to let loose the flood that
held her feelings since the night before. “But
for my husband,” she added, “I should go home
ere this. He promised me to go as soon as the
road was built; but then it costs so much, we
keep on putting off from year to year. But I am
longing so much to go! And when I heard that
word Hillsdale last night, it filled me so full of
home I could not contain myself. I hope you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
were not offended; but it seemed if some one
would come and talk to me, my life would all
be new again! It is so blank, so bleak, so cold
and desolate, and I am heart hungry.” The
tears came fast, and filled her large dark eyes
and softened down her voice to tones of confidence.
With eagerness she spoke of care, and
work and trouble, sorrow and neglect; for, in
his greed of gain, he had forgotten her as year
by year rolled on, and both were growing older
fast, and he not heeding it,&mdash;living on in his
farm, reapers, sheep and crops; his heart was
full of such, and had no room for her, no room
for life.</p>

<p>“And you have been out here for fifteen years?”
I said. “How many years in that long time
have you really lived?”</p>

<p>“Lived!” said Grace&mdash;for this was Grace and
Richard, as you must know ere this&mdash;“lived!”
she replied;&mdash;“in work and trouble a long life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
indeed; in happiness, not one year yet. We
have been waiting every year for that good
time to come when we would find our happiness;
we have not found it yet. The more he
gets, the more he wants. Land means care,
and taxes, and hired men, anxiety of crops, and
overwork.</p>

<p>“I had rather live <em>one year</em> back by the old farm
school-house, when I carried my dinner to my
school, and had a loving group of faces looking
into my eyes each noon, and loving me, than
own all our acres and be here a dozen years.</p>

<p>“Life is not all in years to me! I have learned that
lesson dearly, learned it living where we see so
little of real life that memory is all the hope I
have.”</p>

<p>“Starving amid plenty is cruelty,” I said. “Sell half
and live while you may. You are wasting your
whole lives in a fruitless hunt for happiness.”</p>

<p>I have since learned that my visit was a revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and reform, and that they are living
better.</p>

<p>And I thought, as I turned to the States and
cast a long sad look at the lonely form in the
doorway, and one at the bundle of robes beside
me, who was driving me to the land of daily
enjoyment, if their children had grown up and
lived in such a place, where would have been
their hope? In land and horses! Where their
company? The company of flocks and cattle.
The hope of sometime finding more congenial
quarters. I turned in sadness, saying inwardly,
“God pity the land-poor farmers, and pity
their wives, and show them the lives they are
leading!”</p>

<p class="center xlargefont sansseriffont boldfont">COMMENDATIONS.</p>

<p>“In a careful examination of Dr. Cowan’s SCIENCE OF A NEW LIFE, I
am prepared to give it my very cordial approval. It deserves to be in every family,
and read and pondered, as closely relating to the highest moral and physical well-being
of all its members.... The essential remedy for these
great evils is to be found in Dr. Cowan’s work; therefore, may it be circulated far
and wide.”</p>

<p class="marginrightindent"><span class="smcap">William Lloyd Garrison.</span></p>

<p>“As it is easier to generate a race of healthy men and women than to regenerate
the diseased and discordant humanity we now have, I heartily recommend the study
of THE SCIENCE OF A NEW LIFE to every father and mother in the land.”</p>

<p class="marginrightindent"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth Cady Stanton.</span></p>

<p>“It seems to us to be one of the wisest, and purest, and most helpful of those
Books which have been written in recent years, with the intention of teaching
Men and Women the Truths about their Bodies, which are of peculiar importance
to the morals of Society.... No one can begin to imagine the misery that
has come upon the human family solely through ignorance upon this subject.”</p>
